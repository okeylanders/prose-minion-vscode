# Cost Widget

## Problem

Openrouter is pay-as-you-go platform. Users are unable to quickly see token usage and cost. We should tally the running cost of usage until the component is restarted.

## Location

Title Bar to Left of Settings Icon & Right of Title

## Layout

Text
[x] tokens | $ [x.xxx]
