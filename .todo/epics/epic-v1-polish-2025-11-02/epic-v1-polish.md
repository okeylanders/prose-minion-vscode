**Date**: 2025-11-02
**Status**: Mostly Complete (3/4 sprints done)
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Target**: v1.0 Release Readiness
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-03

## Overview

Final polish pass on Prose Minion's UI/UX before the v1.0 release. This epic focuses on small but impactful improvements that enhance discoverability, usability, and overall user experience without adding major new features.

## Goals

1. **Improve Discoverability**: Make features more visible and understandable
2. **Enhance Interaction**: Add interactive elements where they improve workflow
3. **Refine Visual Feedback**: Ensure users understand what's happening and what they can do
4. **Consistency**: Align UI patterns across tabs and features

## Scope

### In Scope

- Small UI enhancements that improve existing features
- Adding visual indicators for model selections
- Making resource references more interactive
- Refining metrics display and filtering
- Aligning UI patterns across tabs

### Out of Scope

- Architectural changes
- Breaking changes to existing workflows
- Performance optimization (separate epic)

## Notes

- This epic collects the remaining items from `.todo/v1-polish/` that weren't part of other epics
- Each sprint is small (1-2 hours) for quick iteration
- Focus on user-facing improvements, not internal refactoring
- All changes should be non-breaking and backward compatible
