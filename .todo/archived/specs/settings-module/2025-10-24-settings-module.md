# Settings Module

## Problem

Users encountering VSCode for the purposes of prose minion may not be familiar with getting to the settings pane, shortcut keys etc. They may not be engineers and this may be their first time encountering VS Code. We need a dedicated settings module and components to ease the user's intial configuration. Additionally, the settings pane in VS Code limits layout, text context for settings, etc. We can create a more pleasing experience that configures the same settings while providing a more descriptive context and guidance for individual settings. We can also create links to online guides and open router for setup.

## Location & Layout

A small gear icon in the top right corner of the extension will trigger a module to reveal covering entire viewable area.
