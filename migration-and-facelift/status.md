**Wave 0 baseline (the diff target):** 313 tests / 40 suites · extension+webview typechecks CLEAN · webpack both bundles (`extension.js` + `webview.js` 484 KiB, size-warnings only) · `vsce package` deferred (not installed; `@vscode/vsce` added to app devDeps in Wave 3).

## Stage 1 complete — what closed it

This wave finished the last two `vscode` consumers in core:

- **`ConfigurationHandler`** (Wave 4 tail) — its two `showInformationMessage` calls (API key
  saved/cleared) now go through `ShellService`; no more `vscode` import.
- **`MessageHandler`** (Wave 5) — (a) injected `post: (message) => PromiseLike<unknown>`
  replaces the `vscode.Webview` field + `this.webview.postMessage`; (b) the dead `extensionUri`
  ctor param is gone; (c) the `onDidChangeConfiguration` watcher is **relocated to the shell**:
  the provider registers it and forwards a vscode-free `affects(section)` predicate into the new
  public `handleConfigurationChange(affects)` — all broadcast logic stays in core. The
  `vscode.Disposable[]` field is gone (the shell owns the watcher disposable now).
- **`ProseToolsViewProvider`** (shell, keeps `vscode`) — builds the `post` closure
  (`(msg) => webviewView.webview.postMessage(msg)`), registers/disposes the config watcher.
- **Wave 6** — `src/__tests__/architecture/coreVscodeFree.test.ts` scans production `src/` and
  fails if anything outside the two sanctioned shells (+ `platform/vscode/**`) imports `vscode`.

## Verification

- `npm test` → **304 / 304** (37 suites) · `npm run typecheck` (both) → clean ·
  `webpack --mode production` (both bundles) → clean · `vsce package` → `prose-minion-1.10.4.vsix`
  built clean (no `src/`, no tracking docs).
- ✅ **F5 smoke PASSED** (author ran locally 2026-06-17) — sidebar, analysis, word-frequency,
  dictionary, save report, settings round-trip, API key store/clear all working, **and the
  Settings-UI → webview broadcast** (the relocated config watcher) confirmed. The containment
  guard didn't break guide/resource opening. Stage 1 is fully verified and merge-ready.

## Metrics

- **vscode imports remaining in core:** **2 files** (was 37 at Stage-0) — `extension.ts` +
  `ProseToolsViewProvider.ts`, both legitimately shell. **0 real** remaining. Guarded by a test.
- **Tests:** 313 passing / 40 suites (incl. PR #59 review fixups)
- **Ports done:** all seven — `LogSink` ✅, `SecretStore` ✅, `SettingsStore` ✅, `FileSystem` ✅,
  `Workspace` ✅, `EditorContext` ✅, `ShellService` ✅
- **Platform bundle:** assembled in `extension.ts`, threaded provider → MessageHandler

## Notes for the next session (resume point)

- **Resume at Stage 2 Wave 5 — final verify + docs** (first ⬜ in the wave tracker above):
  re-run the full matrix one more time as a single clean pass (both typechecks · 313 tests ·
  app build · `vsce package`), write the changelog entries (`docs/CHANGELOG-DETAILED.md`; the
  Marketplace `apps/vscode-extension/CHANGELOG.md` only if user-visible — this move is not),
  flip status to **Stage 2 COMPLETE**, and hand the author the **F5 smoke** checklist (sidebar,
  analysis, word-frequency, dictionary, save report, settings round-trip, API key store/clear).
- **Wave 4 done — packaging + boundary verified.** `vsce package --no-dependencies` → clean
  `prose-minion-1.10.4.vsix` (128 files / 10.45 MB) shipping `dist/` + `resources/` (all 4
  subdirs, copy-staged from core) + runtime `assets/`, **`src/`-free**. `npm run lint` = 0
  errors (469 pre-existing warnings). The eslint app→core boundary FIRES (a deep `@/`-import in
  a shell file errors with the barrel message). Fixed a Wave-3 slip: an illegal `"//"` key inside
  the eslint `overrides[0]` (schema-invalid) was removed.
- **Wave 3 done — the monorepo move is GREEN.** Structure now: `packages/core` (vscode-free,
  consumed via the `@prose-minion/core` barrel) + `apps/vscode-extension` (the 7 shell files +
  manifest + webpack). Single `tsconfig.base.json` paths table; TS 5.9.3; resources owned by
  `packages/core/resources` and copy-staged into the app for the VSIX (D22). All three typechecks
  clean, 313/313 tests, both webpack bundles. The build/test commands now run from the workspace
  root (`npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`) or per-workspace (`-w apps/vscode-extension`).
- **Behavior delta to note:** root `npm run build` now delegates to the app's webpack only
  (it no longer runs test+typecheck first, as the pre-move single-package `build` did). Run
  `npm test` + `npm run typecheck` explicitly (or in CI). Net coverage unchanged.
- `git fetch` first; dev branch `claude/funny-davinci-yqautn` (off epic @ `ae617df`) is the
  push target (run `npm install` on a fresh container — workspaces relink `@prose-minion/core`).
- Reference chassis: FrameMinion at `../frame-minion-vscode`.
