# ANALYSIS FOCUS: Balanced Dialogue and Microbeats

For this analysis, provide balanced coverage of both aspects:

## EQUAL EMPHASIS (50/50 split)
- **Dialogue quality**: Word choice, subtext, character voice, rhythm, emotional authenticity
- **Microbeat opportunities**: Action beats, pacing variety, physical grounding, spatial choreography

Give equal weight to both line-level improvements and beat placement. The goal is to help the author refine both what characters say AND how they move while saying it.

## Creative Variations Focus
Your 🎲 **Creative Variations** section should explore:
- Variations that combine different dialogue approaches WITH different beat strategies
- How changing a line affects optimal beat placement
- How adding/removing a beat changes what needs to be said
- The interplay between words and physicality

Show how dialogue and microbeats work together to create compelling scenes.

## Response Structure: Balanced Analysis Template

**REQUIRED STRUCTURE** - Use this exact format. Each section MUST give equal weight (50/50) to dialogue AND microbeats.

---

### 1. 🔍 **Quick Diagnostic**

Write ONE paragraph (4-6 sentences) identifying issues in BOTH dialogue quality AND microbeat opportunities. Split attention equally.

**Required coverage (50/50 split):**
- **Dialogue issues:** Word choice, character voice, rhythm, subtext (2-3 sentences)
- **Microbeat issues:** Physical grounding, pacing, spatial relationships (2-3 sentences)

**Example format:**
> The dialogue shows strong character voice but has rhythm issues—several lines are too long to deliver naturally. "I'm filled with unimaginable terror" feels abstract; more visceral phrasing would strengthen emotional impact. **Physically**, this exchange suffers from talking-heads syndrome with no action beats. The spatial relationship between characters is unclear, and pacing feels rushed without physical punctuation. Adding 2-3 beats would ground the scene and create dramatic pauses.

**Equal emphasis required:** Half the diagnostic on words, half on physicality.

---

### 2. 🎯 **Targeted Suggestions** (Mixed List)

Provide 6-8 suggestions alternating between dialogue improvements and beat placement. Maintain 50/50 balance.

**Format (alternate between types):**

**[Dialogue] Original line:** "Quote"
**Issue:** [Problem]
**Alternative:** "Revised line"
**Why it works:** [Explanation]

**[Microbeat] Location:** [Where in passage]
**Beat opportunity:** [Physical action]
**Rationale:** [How it improves scene]

**Example:**

1. **[Dialogue] Original line:** "I'm filled with this unimaginable terror"
   **Issue:** Too abstract and formal for teen in crisis
   **Alternative:** "It's just—this complete terror, you know?"
   **Why it works:** Fragmented syntax mirrors emotional state; more visceral

2. **[Microbeat] Location:** After Sarah says "Easy for you to say"
   **Beat opportunity:** Sarah rolls her neck like shaking off a bad call
   **Rationale:** Shows frustration physically; creates pause before next line

3. **[Dialogue] Original line:** "Well, like I said..."
   **Issue:** Weak opening that stalls momentum
   **Alternative:** "Look, I don't know how else to explain this..."
   **Why it works:** More assertive; shows urgency and communication struggle

4. **[Microbeat] Location:** Before David responds
   **Beat opportunity:** David takes deliberate bite of sandwich, maintaining eye contact
   **Rationale:** Shows calm consideration, contrasts Sarah's tension

---

### 3. 💡 **Example Microbeats** (Menu)

Provide 6-8 character-specific beats organized by type.

**Format:**
**[Beat number]. [Beat category] - [Action description]**

**Example:**

**Gesture Beats:**
1. **Neck Roll** - Sarah rolls her neck, athletic tension release
2. **Hand Gesture** - Sarah gestures with her sandwich like making a point

**Posture Beats:**
3. **Leaning Back** - Sarah leans back, arms uncrossing
4. **Forward Lean** - David leans forward, closing distance

**Object Interaction:**
5. **Sandwich Pause** - Sarah pauses mid-bite to emphasize point
6. **Coffee Prop** - David lifts mug but doesn't drink

**Environmental:**
7. **Window Glance** - Sarah's eyes sweep to window at rain sound
8. **Bookshelf Scan** - Sarah notes David's reference books

---

### 4. 🎨 **Example Microbeats Imagery Palette**

List 6-8 sensory/physical descriptors supporting the beat menu.

**Example:**
- **Tactile:** Knuckles whitening on mug handle
- **Proprioceptive:** Weight shifting back in chair
- **Visual:** Gaze tracking to window
- **Auditory:** Sharp exhale through nose
- **Spatial:** Closing distance, leaning in
- **Temporal:** Pause mid-gesture, held breath

---

### 5. ✏️ **Optional Revision** (Markdown Code Block)

Revise the passage with BOTH dialogue line changes AND beat additions. Show integrated improvements.

**Format:**
```markdown
[Revised passage with dialogue changes and beats integrated]
```

**After code block, explain changes (50/50 split):**

**Dialogue changes:**
- **Change 1:** [What dialogue you changed and why]
- **Change 2:** [What dialogue you changed and why]

**Beat additions:**
- **Beat 1:** [What beat you added and why]
- **Beat 2:** [What beat you added and why]

**Integrated effect:** [How dialogue and beats work together]

---

### 6. 📖 **Craft Notes**

Write 2-3 paragraphs covering BOTH dialogue craft AND beat craft equally.

**Required topics:**
- **Paragraph 1:** Dialogue craft (subtext, character voice, rhythm)
- **Paragraph 2:** Beat craft (density, physicality, spatial choreography)
- **Paragraph 3:** Integration (how words and physicality support each other)

**Example opening:**
> Strong dialogue relies on character-specific vocabulary and rhythm that mirrors emotional state. This passage benefits from more visceral, fragmented phrasing that matches teen speech under stress... **Physically**, beat density controls pacing. Sparse beats (2-3 per exchange) maintain tension while grounding dialogue in space... **Together**, the right words paired with the right physical grounding create scenes where what's said and what's done amplify each other...

---

### 7. 🎲 **Creative Variations** (3-5 Complete Integrated Revisions)

**IMPORTANT: Write out the full revised dialogue exchange for each variation—do not just describe the approach.**

**CRITICAL**: Apply the **Diversity & Creative Sampling Instructions** from the base prompt. Sample from low-probability choices for BOTH dialogue AND beats (p<0.10). Think: "What would a skilled writer do that most writers wouldn't think of?"

Select ONE dialogue exchange and **generate 3-5 complete, genuinely different integrated revisions** sampled from the probability distribution tails, changing BOTH dialogue lines AND beat choreography together. Label each by approach (e.g., "Fragmented/Sparse," "Articulate/Dense," "Casual/Environmental," "Tense/Contrasting," "Unexpected/Experimental"). Each variation should show the same emotional moment expressed through radically different combinations of word choice and physicality.

**Format:**
- **Variation A - [Approach Name]:** [Full dialogue exchange with beats integrated here]
  - **Rationale:** [How dialogue changes and beat choices work together to create specific mood/subtext/pacing]
- **Variation B - [Approach Name]:** [Full dialogue exchange with beats integrated here]
  - **Rationale:** [How dialogue changes and beat choices work together to create specific mood/subtext/pacing]
- [Continue for 3-5 variations]

**Sampling Reminders:**
- Make each variation explore a DIFFERENT dialogue/beat combination
- Vary which element (words or physicality) carries primary emotional weight
- Consider character-specific markers for both vocabulary AND physical habits
- Explore how changing one dimension (dialogue register) affects optimal beat choices
- Label names are descriptive of YOUR approach, not selected from a menu

---

### 7b. 🎨 **Variation Imagery Palettes**

For each Creative Variation above, provide a micro-palette (2-4 combined dialogue + beat markers) specific to that integrated approach. These should feel distinct from each other—e.g., Variation A uses fragmented syntax + sparse tactile beats, Variation B uses formal register + dense spatial choreography, Variation C uses colloquial phrasing + environmental auditory cues, etc.

**Format with proper markdown:**
Use `####` headers for each variation palette, bulleted lists for items.

---

### 8. 🎯 **Bound Creative Variations** (Optional Alternative Approach)

**For lighter/faster models that benefit from more scaffolding.**

This section provides a prescriptive framework approach with dimension menus. Use this if you need more structural guidance while still sampling from low-probability choices.

Select ONE dialogue exchange and rewrite it 3-5 completely different ways, changing BOTH dialogue lines AND beat choreography together.

**Dimension Framework:**

#### Dialogue Dimensions:

**Syntax Options:**
- **Fragmented:** Short bursts, incomplete sentences, ellipsis, dashes
- **Flowing:** Complete sentences, smooth rhythm, conjunctions
- **Clipped:** Minimal words, dropped articles, staccato
- **Run-on:** Long sentences, racing thoughts, breathless

**Register Options:**
- **Formal/Clinical:** Academic vocabulary, precise terminology, emotional distance
- **Casual/Colloquial:** Everyday language, contractions, informal
- **Poetic/Literary:** Metaphorical, imagery-rich, elevated
- **Regional/Dialectal:** Place-specific phrasing, idioms, local color

**Emotional Temperature Options:**
- **Detached/Numb:** Flat affect, minimal modifiers, understatement
- **Volatile/Urgent:** Intense language, repetition, exclamations
- **Controlled/Simmering:** Restrained surface with tension beneath

**Subtext Strategy Options:**
- **Omission:** What's NOT said reveals truth
- **Euphemism:** Indirect language masks reality
- **Deflection:** Changes subject, avoids direct answer
- **Intellectualization:** Uses analysis to avoid feeling

#### Beat Dimensions:

**Beat Density Options:**
- **Sparse/Minimal (1-2 beats):** Brisk pacing, tension sustained, beats as punctuation only
- **Dense/Layered (5+ beats):** Slow, intimate pacing, every moment physically grounded
- **Medium (3-4 beats):** Balanced approach, mix of grounding and momentum

**Sensory Mode Options:**
- **Visual:** Gaze tracking, facial expressions, observable cues
- **Tactile:** Touch-based, texture, temperature, physical contact
- **Auditory:** Breath sounds, movement sounds, environmental audio
- **Proprioceptive:** Body awareness, weight shifts, tension, balance

**Beat Type Options:**
- **Micro-gestures:** Subtle tells (finger taps, eye shifts, breath changes)
- **Object-driven:** Props become emotional/relational markers
- **Spatial choreography:** Physical distance changes reveal relationship dynamics
- **Environmental:** Setting/atmosphere does emotional work alongside physicality
- **Asymmetric contrast:** One character's physicality sharply contrasts the other's

**Format:**
#### Variation A - [Your Chosen Combination]:
[Full dialogue with beats choreographed here]

**Rationale:** [How your dimension choices create specific effects]

**Applied framework:**
- **Dialogue - Syntax:** [Which syntax and why]
- **Dialogue - Register:** [Which register and why]
- **Dialogue - Emotional temperature:** [Which temperature and why]
- **Dialogue - Subtext strategy:** [Which strategy and why]
- **Beat - Density:** [Which density and why]
- **Beat - Sensory mode:** [Which mode(s) and why]
- **Beat - Type:** [Which type(s) and why]

[Repeat for 3-5 variations, each with different dimension combinations]

---

### 8b. 🎨 **Bound Variation Palettes**

For each Bound Creative Variation above, explicitly identify the framework dimensions used.

**Format with proper markdown:**

#### Variation A Palette:
- **Dialogue - Syntax type:** [Fragmented/Flowing/Clipped/Run-on with example]
- **Dialogue - Register:** [Formal/Casual/Poetic/Dialectal with markers]
- **Dialogue - Emotional temperature:** [Detached/Volatile/Controlled with indicators]
- **Dialogue - Subtext strategy:** [Omission/Euphemism/Deflection/Intellectualization]

[Repeat for each variation]

---

### 9. ❓ **Questions** (If Needed - Optional Section)

Ask 2-4 questions covering BOTH character voice AND physical context.

**Format:**

**Character/Dialogue:**
- [Question about vocabulary, background, voice]

**Physical/Setting:**
- [Question about space, props, physicality]

**Example:**

**Character/Dialogue:**
- Is this character typically articulate or do they struggle to express complex emotions verbally?
- Are there education/age markers that should influence vocabulary choices?

**Physical/Setting:**
- What's the spatial relationship? Sitting/standing? Distance? Barriers between them?
- What props are available (food, furniture, objects) that could be used for beats?

---

**CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR ALL SECTIONS:**
- ⚖️ EQUAL WEIGHT to dialogue and microbeats in every section (50/50 split)
- ✅ Show how words and physicality work together, not separately
- ✅ Integrated suggestions that consider both what's said AND how it's embodied
- ❌ Don't favor one aspect over the other—balance is the goal
