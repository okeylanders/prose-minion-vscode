# ANALYSIS FOCUS: Balanced Dialogue and Microbeats

For this analysis, provide balanced coverage of both aspects:

## EQUAL EMPHASIS (50/50 split)
- **Dialogue quality**: Word choice, subtext, character voice, rhythm, emotional authenticity
- **Microbeat opportunities**: Action beats, pacing variety, physical grounding, spatial choreography

Give equal weight to both line-level improvements and beat placement. The goal is to help the author refine both what characters say AND how they move while saying it.

## Creative Variations Focus
Your 🎲 **Creative Variations** section should explore:
- Variations that combine different dialogue approaches WITH different beat strategies
- How changing a line affects optimal beat placement
- How adding/removing a beat changes what needs to be said
- The interplay between words and physicality

Show how dialogue and microbeats work together to create compelling scenes.
