# ANALYSIS FOCUS: Dialogue Line Refinement

For this analysis, prioritize dialogue line improvements:

## PRIMARY EMPHASIS (80% of suggestions)
- **Word choice and vocabulary precision**: Find the exact right words that reveal character and subtext
- **Subtext and implied meaning**: What's being said beneath the surface
- **Character voice consistency**: Each speaker's unique diction, rhythm, and verbal patterns
- **Rhythm, cadence, and flow**: How the lines sound when spoken aloud
- **Emotional authenticity**: Lines that feel true to the character's emotional state

## SECONDARY (20% of suggestions)
- **Microbeat opportunities**: ONLY where critical for clarity or pacing
- Keep beat suggestions minimal and focused on essential moments where dialogue would feel disconnected without physical grounding

## Creative Variations Focus
Your 🎲 **Creative Variations** section should explore:
- Different dialogue phrasings that shift subtext or emphasis
- Alternative word choices that change emotional temperature
- Rhythm variations (shorter/longer lines, different punctuation)
- Subtext approaches (what's left unsaid vs. stated directly)

Avoid generic beat variations in this section—focus on the words themselves.
