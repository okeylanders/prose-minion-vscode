# ANALYSIS FOCUS: Dialogue Line Refinement

**CRITICAL**: This analysis focuses on **the actual spoken words** characters say, NOT on adding physical actions or microbeats around dialogue. Critique and improve the dialogue lines themselves.

## PRIMARY EMPHASIS (80% of suggestions)

Focus on **what characters actually say** (the words inside quotation marks):

- **Word choice in dialogue lines**: Are these the exact right words for this character? Is "unimaginable terror" too vague? Would "gut-wrenching fear" be more specific? Does "kind of melts" match the character's vocabulary?

- **Diction and vocabulary authenticity**: Does each line sound like THIS character would say it? Are they using phrases that fit their background, education, personality? Teen vs. adult vocabulary? Formal vs. casual register?

- **Rhythm and cadence of spoken lines**: Read the dialogue aloud. Does it flow naturally? Are sentences too long to deliver in one breath? Do shorter/longer lines create the right emotional tempo? Try: "I keep ending up in random places" vs. "I end up in these places—forests, fields, oceans."

- **Subtext and implied meaning**: What's being communicated beneath the literal words? Can we make subtext clearer or more layered? Example: "Well, like I said" shows hesitation—could we make that even stronger with "Look, I don't know how else to say this"?

- **Emotional authenticity in phrasing**: Do the words reflect the character's emotional state? Does someone in terror use precise language, or would they fragment? "I'm filled with this unimaginable terror" vs. "It's just—this complete terror, you know?"

- **Character voice consistency across lines**: Do all this character's lines feel like the same person speaking? Are there vocabulary or syntax patterns that should repeat?

## WHAT NOT TO DO

**DO NOT** suggest adding microbeats, physical actions, or gestures. Examples of what to AVOID:

❌ "Replace this dialogue tag with a microbeat showing nervousness"
❌ "Add a beat of him clenching his fork to show tension"
❌ "Have her lean forward to demonstrate engagement"
❌ "Show his trembling hands instead of saying he's nervous"

**These are beat suggestions, not dialogue improvements.**

## SECONDARY (20% of suggestions maximum)

- **Critical dialogue tag/beat issues ONLY**: Only mention beats if a line is literally incomprehensible without physical context, or if an existing beat contradicts what the character is saying.

Example where mentioning a beat is appropriate:
> "I'm fine," she said, while trembling.
→ Suggestion: Either change the line to acknowledge she's not fine, or remove the contradictory beat.

## Creative Variations Focus

Your 🎲 **Creative Variations** section should show **alternative dialogue lines**:

**Example format:**
> Original: "I keep ending up in random places—forests, fields, oceans, waterfalls—wilderness-type places."

**Variation 1** (shorter, more fragmented): "Random places. Forests. Fields. Oceans. Always wilderness."
**Variation 2** (more poetic): "Wild places keep pulling me in—deep forests, endless fields, churning oceans."
**Variation 3** (more character voice): "It's always the same. I'm suddenly just... there. In some forest or field I've never seen."

Show how **different word choices, sentence structures, and phrasings** change subtext, emotional temperature, or character voice.

**DO NOT** include beat variations, gesture variations, or physical staging variations in this section.
