# ANALYSIS FOCUS: Dialogue Line Refinement

**CRITICAL**: This analysis focuses on **the actual spoken words** characters say, NOT on adding physical actions or microbeats around dialogue. Critique and improve the dialogue lines themselves.

## PRIMARY EMPHASIS (80% of suggestions)

Focus on **what characters actually say** (the words inside quotation marks):

- **Word choice in dialogue lines**: Are these the exact right words for this character? Is "unimaginable terror" too vague? Would "gut-wrenching fear" be more specific? Does "kind of melts" match the character's vocabulary?

- **Diction and vocabulary authenticity**: Does each line sound like THIS character would say it? Are they using phrases that fit their background, education, personality? Teen vs. adult vocabulary? Formal vs. casual register?

- **Rhythm and cadence of spoken lines**: Read the dialogue aloud. Does it flow naturally? Are sentences too long to deliver in one breath? Do shorter/longer lines create the right emotional tempo? Try: "I keep ending up in random places" vs. "I end up in these places—forests, fields, oceans."

- **Subtext and implied meaning**: What's being communicated beneath the literal words? Can we make subtext clearer or more layered? Example: "Well, like I said" shows hesitation—could we make that even stronger with "Look, I don't know how else to say this"?

- **Emotional authenticity in phrasing**: Do the words reflect the character's emotional state? Does someone in terror use precise language, or would they fragment? "I'm filled with this unimaginable terror" vs. "It's just—this complete terror, you know?"

- **Character voice consistency across lines**: Do all this character's lines feel like the same person speaking? Are there vocabulary or syntax patterns that should repeat?

## WHAT NOT TO DO

**DO NOT** suggest adding microbeats, physical actions, or gestures. Examples of what to AVOID:

❌ "Replace this dialogue tag with a microbeat showing nervousness"
❌ "Add a beat of him clenching his fork to show tension"
❌ "Have her lean forward to demonstrate engagement"
❌ "Show his trembling hands instead of saying he's nervous"

**These are beat suggestions, not dialogue improvements.**

## SECONDARY (20% of suggestions maximum)

- **Critical dialogue tag/beat issues ONLY**: Only mention beats if a line is literally incomprehensible without physical context, or if an existing beat contradicts what the character is saying.

Example where mentioning a beat is appropriate:
> "I'm fine," she said, while trembling.
→ Suggestion: Either change the line to acknowledge she's not fine, or remove the contradictory beat.

## Creative Variations Focus

Your 🎲 **Creative Variations** section should show **alternative dialogue lines**:

**Example format:**
> Original: "I keep ending up in random places—forests, fields, oceans, waterfalls—wilderness-type places."

**Variation 1** (shorter, more fragmented): "Random places. Forests. Fields. Oceans. Always wilderness."
**Variation 2** (more poetic): "Wild places keep pulling me in—deep forests, endless fields, churning oceans."
**Variation 3** (more character voice): "It's always the same. I'm suddenly just... there. In some forest or field I've never seen."

Show how **different word choices, sentence structures, and phrasings** change subtext, emotional temperature, or character voice.

**DO NOT** include beat variations, gesture variations, or physical staging variations in this section.

## OVERRIDE: Modified Response Structure for Dialogue Focus

**REQUIRED STRUCTURE** - Use this exact format instead of the default template. Each section is MANDATORY.

---

### 1. 🔍 **Quick Diagnostic**

Write ONE paragraph (3-5 sentences) identifying dialogue-specific issues ONLY:
- Word choice precision issues
- Vocabulary authenticity problems
- Rhythm/cadence problems
- Subtext clarity issues
- Emotional authenticity gaps
- Character voice consistency breaks

**Example format:**
> The dialogue has several word choice issues that undermine character voice. "I'm filled with this unimaginable terror" feels too formal for a teen character in crisis—teens fragment under stress. The line "Well, like I said" shows hesitation but could be stronger. Overall rhythm is good, but a few lines are too long to deliver naturally in one breath.

**DO NOT mention beats, gestures, or physical actions in this section.**

---

### 2. 🎯 **Dialogue Line Suggestions** (Bulleted List)

Provide 3-6 concrete suggestions. Each suggestion MUST follow this format:

**Original line:** "Exact quote from passage"
**Issue:** [Brief explanation of the problem]
**Alternative:** "Proposed new dialogue line"
**Why it works:** [How the new wording improves character voice, subtext, or emotional authenticity]

**Example:**
- **Original line:** "I'm filled with this unimaginable terror"
  **Issue:** Too formal/articulate for a teen in crisis; abstract instead of visceral
  **Alternative:** "It's just—this complete terror, you know? Like I can't even—"
  **Why it works:** Fragmented syntax mirrors emotional state; "you know?" is authentic teen speech seeking validation

**DO NOT suggest adding beats or physical actions.**

---

### 3. 💬 **Alternative Dialogue Phrasings** (Menu)

Select 2-3 key dialogue lines and provide 4-6 alternative phrasings for EACH line. Show how different word choices change meaning.

**Format for each line:**

**Original:** "Exact quote"

**Alternative 1** ([approach descriptor]): "New dialogue line"
**Alternative 2** ([approach descriptor]): "New dialogue line"
**Alternative 3** ([approach descriptor]): "New dialogue line"
**Alternative 4** ([approach descriptor]): "New dialogue line"

**Example:**

**Original:** "I keep ending up in random places—forests, fields, oceans, waterfalls—wilderness-type places."

**Alternative 1** (fragmented/breathless): "Random places. Forests. Fields. Oceans. Always... wilderness."
**Alternative 2** (poetic/literary): "Wild places keep pulling me in—deep forests, endless fields, churning oceans."
**Alternative 3** (matter-of-fact/numb): "It's always the same. I'm suddenly just there. Some forest or field I've never seen."
**Alternative 4** (frustrated/urgent): "Why is it always wilderness? Forests, oceans, fields—never a city, never somewhere with people who could help."

---

### 4. 🎨 **Vocabulary Palette**

List 6-8 vocabulary choices and diction patterns that fit this character's voice. Format as bulleted list with explanations.

**Required categories to address:**
- Register (formal vs. casual)
- Age markers (teen slang, adult phrasing)
- Education level (colloquial vs. academic)
- Sentence rhythm patterns (fragmented, flowing, clipped)

**Example format:**
- **Fragmentation under stress:** "I just—it's like—I can't even—" (shows emotional overwhelm)
- **Hedging phrases:** "kind of," "sort of," "you know?" (teen authenticity, seeking validation)
- **Sensory concreteness:** "gut-wrenching" instead of "bad," "churning panic" instead of "fear"
- **Short declaratives:** "I end up there. I don't know why. It just happens." (creates urgency)
- **Casual register:** "freaking out" vs. "experiencing anxiety" (age-appropriate)
- **Question fragments:** "Why now? Why me?" (shows internal thought process)

---

### 5. ✏️ **Optional Revision** (Markdown Code Block)

Revise the passage with ONLY dialogue line changes. Keep all narrative/beats unchanged unless a dialogue tag directly contradicts the new line.

**Format:**
```markdown
[Revised passage here - only dialogue lines modified]
```

**After the code block, add brief explanations:**
- **Change 1:** [What you changed and why]
- **Change 2:** [What you changed and why]

**Example explanation:**
- **Change 1:** Replaced "unimaginable terror" with fragmented "this complete terror, you know?" to match teen speech patterns and emotional overwhelm
- **Change 2:** Shortened long explanation to "Random places. Always wilderness." for breathless urgency

---

### 6. 📖 **Craft Notes**

Write 2-3 paragraphs about dialogue craft ONLY. Address:
- Subtext techniques used or suggested
- Character voice differentiation strategies
- Rhythm and cadence principles applied

**DO NOT discuss beats, pacing via action, or physical staging.**

**Example opening:**
> Strong dialogue relies on character-specific vocabulary patterns. This character's age and emotional state should drive word choice toward fragmentation and sensory concreteness rather than analytical distance...

---

### 7. 🎲 **Creative Variations** (3-5 Complete Rewrites)

**CRITICAL**: Apply the **Diversity & Creative Sampling Instructions** from the base prompt. Sample from low-probability vocabulary and syntax choices (p<0.10). Avoid obvious phrasings. Think: "What would a skilled writer do that most writers wouldn't think of?"

Select ONE key dialogue exchange and rewrite it 3-5 completely different ways. Each variation explores a different stylistic approach.

**REQUIRED FORMAT for each variation:**

**Variation A - [Approach Name]:**
```
[Complete dialogue rewrite showing this approach]
```
**Rationale:** [2-3 sentences explaining how word choice/structure changes subtext, emotional temperature, or character voice]

**Stylistic Approaches to Explore** (choose 3-5 DIFFERENT directions):
- **Syntax variations:** Fragmented vs. flowing vs. clipped vs. run-on
- **Register shifts:** Formal/clinical vs. casual/colloquial vs. poetic/literary
- **Emotional temperature:** Detached/numb vs. volatile/urgent vs. controlled/simmering
- **Subtext strategies:** What's NOT said, implications, euphemisms, deflection
- **Rhythm patterns:** Staccato (short bursts) vs. lyrical (flowing) vs. stuttering (hesitation)
- **Vocabulary registers:** Teen slang vs. adult phrasing vs. educated/academic vs. regional dialect
- **Sensory specificity:** Abstract ("terror") vs. visceral ("gut-wrenching") vs. metaphorical
- **Defensive mechanisms:** Intellectualization, minimization, humor, aggression

**Sampling Reminders:**
- Mine character background for vocabulary markers (profession, education, region, age)
- Explore sentence structures that mirror emotional state (fragments = overwhelm, run-ons = racing thoughts)
- Consider what the character would AVOID saying (revealing via omission)
- Make each variation explore a DIFFERENT register/rhythm/subtext combination

---

### 8. 🎨 **Variation Vocabulary Palettes**

For EACH variation above, list 3-4 key vocabulary/diction categories that define that approach. Focus on the **type of language choice**, not specific words.

**Format:**

**Variation A Palette:**
- [Vocabulary category with functional description]
- [Syntax pattern with effect on meaning]
- [Register marker with character implications]

**Example Structure** (NOT specific words):
- **[Syntax type]:** [How this structure affects pacing/emotion]
- **[Register descriptor]:** [What this vocabulary level reveals about character]
- **[Rhetorical device]:** [How this technique creates subtext]
- **[Emotional tell]:** [What linguistic choice reveals about state]

---

### 9. ❓ **Questions** (If Needed - Optional Section)

Ask 1-3 specific questions about character background, education level, or relationship dynamics that would help refine vocabulary choices.

**Format:**
- Question about [specific aspect]: [Concrete question]

**Example:**
- Character age/education: Is this character college-educated, or would they use more colloquial phrasing?
- Emotional baseline: Does this character typically intellectualize emotions, or is this defensive behavior new?
- Regional dialect: Are there regional speech patterns (Southern, urban, rural) that should influence vocabulary?

---

**CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR ALL SECTIONS:**
- ❌ NO beat suggestions, gesture descriptions, or physical actions
- ❌ NO discussion of blocking, pacing via movement, or spatial choreography
- ✅ ONLY dialogue line critique, word choice analysis, and vocabulary refinement
- ✅ Focus on what characters SAY, not what they DO
