# ANALYSIS FOCUS: Action Beats and Physical Grounding

For this analysis, prioritize microbeat suggestions:

## PRIMARY EMPHASIS (80% of suggestions)
- **Breaking up long dialogue sequences**: Add physical action to prevent talking-heads syndrome
- **Physical grounding and setting details**: Anchor dialogue in space with gesture, movement, and environment
- **Pacing variety through action**: Use beats to control tempo and create dramatic pauses
- **Showing character state via movement**: Reveal emotion, intention, and relationships through physicality
- **Preventing static dialogue**: Give characters bodies and spatial relationships

## SECONDARY (20% of suggestions)
- **Dialogue issues**: ONLY where they directly impact beat placement or pacing
- Keep dialogue critique minimal and structural (e.g., "This line is too long to deliver without a breath")

## Creative Variations Focus
Your 🎲 **Creative Variations** section should explore:
- Different beat types (gesture, posture, spatial moves, object interaction)
- Variations in beat density (heavy vs. sparse)
- Different physical actions that convey the same emotional state
- Pacing rhythms (where to place beats for maximum dramatic impact)

Avoid line rewrites in this section—focus on the physical and spatial choreography.

## OVERRIDE: Modified Response Structure for Microbeats Focus

**REQUIRED STRUCTURE** - Use this exact format instead of the default template. Each section is MANDATORY.

---

### 1. 🔍 **Quick Diagnostic**

Write ONE paragraph (3-5 sentences) identifying microbeat opportunities ONLY:
- Long unbroken dialogue sequences (talking-heads syndrome)
- Static exchanges lacking physical grounding
- Missing spatial relationships between characters
- Pacing issues (too fast/slow without physical punctuation)
- Moments where emotion should be shown physically, not told

**Example format:**
> This exchange suffers from talking-heads syndrome—four lines of dialogue with no physical grounding. The spatial relationship between characters is unclear (are they sitting, standing, facing each other?). The pacing is rushed; adding beats would create dramatic pauses and give weight to emotional revelations. Sarah's frustration needs physical expression beyond the word "countered."

**DO NOT critique dialogue wording or vocabulary choices in this section unless they directly impact beat placement.**

---

### 2. 🎯 **Microbeat Placement Suggestions** (Bulleted List)

Provide 4-6 concrete suggestions for where to add action beats. Each suggestion MUST follow this format:

**Location:** [Identify the specific dialogue moment]
**Beat opportunity:** [What physical action should be added]
**Rationale:** [How this beat improves pacing, clarity, or character revelation]

**Example:**
- **Location:** After Sarah says "Easy for you to say"
  **Beat opportunity:** Sarah rolls her neck like shaking off a bad call, releasing athletic tension
  **Rationale:** Shows frustration is physical, not personal—an athlete's reset gesture. Creates pause before her next line, giving weight to "You weren't the one seeing impossible things."

- **Location:** Before David responds
  **Beat opportunity:** David takes a deliberate bite of his sandwich, chewing slowly while maintaining eye contact
  **Rationale:** His calm, unflappable physicality contrasts Sarah's tension. The beat shows he's considering her words, not dismissing them. Creates space for emotional temperature to drop.

**DO NOT suggest changing dialogue words—focus only on physical actions.**

---

### 3. 💡 **Example Microbeats** (Menu of 8-12 Options)

Provide 8-12 character-specific beat options organized by beat type. Show physical variety.

**REQUIRED CATEGORIES (2-3 beats each):**
- **Gesture (hands, face):** Small physical tells
- **Posture (body position):** Shifts in stance or seating
- **Spatial Movement:** Moving closer/farther, entering/exiting space
- **Object Interaction:** Using props in the scene
- **Environmental Interaction:** Engaging with setting details

**Format for each beat:**
**[Beat number]. [Beat category] - [Action description]**

**Example:**

**Gesture Beats:**
1. **Neck Roll** - Sarah rolls her neck like shaking off a bad call
2. **Half-Smirk** - One corner of Sarah's mouth twitches into a half-smirk that doesn't reach her eyes
3. **Hand Through Hair** - David runs his hand through his hair, a rare tell of uncertainty

**Posture Beats:**
4. **Leaning Back** - Sarah leans back in her chair, arms uncrossing
5. **Forward Lean** - David leans forward, elbows on desk, closing the space between them
6. **Shoulder Drop** - Sarah's shoulders drop from tension to resignation

**Spatial Movement:**
7. **Pacing to Window** - Sarah pushes up from her chair and paces to the window
8. **Closing Distance** - David steps around his desk, reducing the authority gap

**Object Interaction:**
9. **Sandwich Gesture** - Sarah gestures with her sandwich like a coach with a clipboard
10. **Coffee Pause** - David lifts his coffee mug but doesn't drink, using it as a thinking prop

**Environmental Interaction:**
11. **Bookshelf Glance** - Sarah's eyes sweep David's bookshelves before settling back on him
12. **Rain Sound** - Sarah turns toward the window at the sound of rain intensifying

### 4. 🎨 **Microbeats Imagery Palette**

List 8-12 sensory/physical descriptors that support the microbeat menu. Include multiple sensory modes.

**REQUIRED CATEGORIES:**
- **Tactile:** Touch-based descriptors
- **Proprioceptive:** Body-awareness descriptors (weight shifts, tension)
- **Visual:** Observable physical cues
- **Auditory:** Sounds of movement or breath
- **Spatial:** Distance and positioning descriptors

**Format:**
- **[Category] - [Descriptor]:** [When/how to use]

**Example:**

**Tactile:**
- **Knuckles whitening:** When character grips object (steering wheel, armrest, mug) under stress
- **Fingertip drum:** Light, rhythmic tapping showing impatience or thinking

**Proprioceptive:**
- **Weight shifting:** Character's center of gravity moves (leaning, rocking, stepping back)
- **Tension release:** Shoulders dropping, jaw unclenching, breath deepening

**Visual:**
- **Gaze tracking:** Eyes following movement or avoiding contact
- **Micro-expressions:** Fleeting facial movements before composure returns

**Auditory:**
- **Breath patterns:** Sharp exhale, held breath, sigh
- **Movement sounds:** Chair creak, footsteps, door click

**Spatial:**
- **Closing distance:** Moving into personal space (intimacy or confrontation)
- **Opening distance:** Creating buffer zone (retreat or giving space)

---

### 5. ✏️ **Optional Revision** (Markdown Code Block)

Add beats to the dialogue passage. Keep dialogue lines UNCHANGED unless absolutely necessary.

**Format:**
```markdown
[Revised passage with beats inserted]
```

**After the code block, explain your beat placement strategy:**
- **Beat placement strategy:** [1-2 sentences on overall approach]
- **Key beat 1:** [Which beat you added and why]
- **Key beat 2:** [Which beat you added and why]
- **Pacing effect:** [How beats change the tempo and emotional impact]

**Example explanation:**
- **Beat placement strategy:** Added sparse beats (3 total) to ground the exchange physically without slowing pace. Focused on contrasting Sarah's tension (athletic reset) with David's calm (steady eating).
- **Key beat 1:** Neck roll after "countered" - shows frustration is physical, not anger
- **Key beat 2:** David's deliberate bite - unflappable calm creates dramatic contrast
- **Pacing effect:** Beats create two natural pauses, allowing emotional temperature to modulate without dialogue changes

---

### 6. 📖 **Craft Notes**

Write 2-3 paragraphs about beat craft ONLY. Address:
- Beat density for pacing (sparse vs. dense choreography)
- Character-specific physicality (how beats reveal personality)
- Spatial choreography (blocking and physical relationships)
- Preventing talking-heads syndrome
- Using beats to show rather than tell emotional state

**DO NOT discuss dialogue wording, vocabulary, or line-level improvements.**

**Example opening:**
> Beat density is a powerful pacing tool. Sparse beats (1-2 per exchange) create brisk, urgent pacing and work well for tense confrontations where words matter most. Dense beats (4+ per exchange) slow the pace, creating intimate or contemplative moments where physicality reveals as much as dialogue...

---

### 7. 🎲 **Creative Variations** (3-5 Complete Beat Choreographies)

**CRITICAL**: Apply the **Diversity & Creative Sampling Instructions** from the base prompt. Sample from low-probability beat choices (p<0.10). Avoid obvious gestures (head nods, sighs, crossed arms). Think: "What would a skilled writer do that most writers wouldn't think of?"

Select ONE static dialogue exchange and add beats 3-5 completely different ways. Keep dialogue IDENTICAL across all variations—only beat placement and density change.

**REQUIRED FORMAT for each variation:**

**Variation A - [Approach Name] ([Beat Density descriptor]):**
```markdown
[Same dialogue with beats choreographed using this approach]
```
**Rationale:** [2-3 sentences explaining how this beat density creates specific pacing/mood and what the physicality reveals about character state]

**Variation Types to Explore** (choose 3-5):
- **Sparse/Minimal (1-2 beats):** Brisk pacing, tension sustained, beats as punctuation only
- **Dense/Layered (5+ beats):** Slow, intimate pacing, every moment physically grounded
- **Environmental (3-4 beats):** Setting/atmosphere does emotional work alongside character physicality
- **Micro-gesture focused:** Subtle tells (finger taps, eye movements, breath patterns)
- **Object-driven:** Props become emotional/relational markers
- **Spatial choreography:** Physical distance changes reveal relationship dynamics
- **Sensory-rich:** Tactile, auditory, proprioceptive beats create immersive grounding
- **Asymmetric contrast:** One character's physicality sharply contrasts the other's

**Sampling Reminders:**
- Mine character background for profession-specific gestures (athlete, teacher, musician, etc.)
- Consider setting-unique beats that couldn't exist elsewhere
- Vary sensory modes across variations (visual → tactile → auditory → proprioceptive)
- Make each variation explore a DIFFERENT part of the beat possibility space

---

### 8. 🎨 **Variation Beat Palettes**

For EACH variation above, list 3-4 key beat types or categories that define that approach. Focus on the **type of physicality**, not specific gestures.

**Format:**

**Variation A Palette:**
- [Beat type/category with functional description]
- [Beat type/category with functional description]
- [Beat type/category with functional description]

**Example Structure** (NOT beat content):
- **[Category]:** [What this type of beat reveals or accomplishes]
- **[Sensory mode]:** [How this sensory approach affects the scene]
- **[Density descriptor]:** [How pacing/tempo is affected]
- **[Relational function]:** [What this reveals about character dynamics]

---

### 9. ❓ **Questions** (If Needed - Optional Section)

Ask 1-3 specific questions about setting details, available props, spatial relationships, or character physical habits.

**Format:**
- Question about [specific aspect]: [Concrete question]

**Example:**
- **Setting details:** What objects are available in this scene (furniture, props, food/drink) that could be used for beats?
- **Spatial relationship:** Are the characters sitting or standing? How far apart? Any barriers (desk, table) between them?
- **Character physicality:** Does this character have any physical habits (fidgeting, pacing, specific gestures) I should incorporate?
- **Atmospheric elements:** Are there environmental sounds or sensory details (rain, traffic, music) that could ground beats?

---

**CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR ALL SECTIONS:**
- ❌ NO dialogue line rewrites or vocabulary changes (unless beat requires clarification)
- ❌ NO discussion of subtext, character voice, or dialogue rhythm (unless beat-related)
- ✅ ONLY beat placement, choreography, spatial relationships, and physical grounding
- ✅ Focus on what characters DO, not what they SAY
