# ANALYSIS FOCUS: Action Beats and Physical Grounding

For this analysis, prioritize microbeat suggestions:

## PRIMARY EMPHASIS (80% of suggestions)
- **Breaking up long dialogue sequences**: Add physical action to prevent talking-heads syndrome
- **Physical grounding and setting details**: Anchor dialogue in space with gesture, movement, and environment
- **Pacing variety through action**: Use beats to control tempo and create dramatic pauses
- **Showing character state via movement**: Reveal emotion, intention, and relationships through physicality
- **Preventing static dialogue**: Give characters bodies and spatial relationships

## SECONDARY (20% of suggestions)
- **Dialogue issues**: ONLY where they directly impact beat placement or pacing
- Keep dialogue critique minimal and structural (e.g., "This line is too long to deliver without a breath")

## Creative Variations Focus
Your 🎲 **Creative Variations** section should explore:
- Different beat types (gesture, posture, spatial moves, object interaction)
- Variations in beat density (heavy vs. sparse)
- Different physical actions that convey the same emotional state
- Pacing rhythms (where to place beats for maximum dramatic impact)

Avoid line rewrites in this section—focus on the physical and spatial choreography.

## OVERRIDE: Modified Response Structure for Microbeats Focus

Use this structure instead of the default template:

1. 🔍 **Quick Diagnostic**
   - One paragraph identifying microbeat opportunities: long unbroken dialogue, static exchanges, missing physical grounding, unclear spatial relationships, pacing issues

2. 🎯 **Microbeat Placement Suggestions** (Bulleted)
   - Concrete suggestions for where to add action beats
   - Identify specific moments that need physical grounding
   - Include rationale: How does this beat improve pacing, clarity, or character revelation?

3. 💡 **Example Microbeats** (Menu)
   - 8–12 character-specific beats (gesture, posture, spatial moves, object interaction)
   - Aligned with the scene's tone and character personalities
   - Show physical variety: hands, face, posture, movement, environment interaction

4. 🎨 **Microbeats Imagery Palette**
   - 8–12 sensory/physical descriptors supporting the microbeat menu
   - Specific vocabulary for gestures, spatial moves, and physical cues
   - Include tactile, proprioceptive, spatial, and auditory options

5. ✏️ **Optional Revision** (Markdown Code Block)
   - Add beats to break up dialogue sequences
   - Show before/after for 1-2 key moments
   - Explain beat placement strategy (pacing, grounding, character state)

6. 📖 **Craft Notes**
   - Focus on beat craft: beat density for pacing, character-specific physicality, spatial choreography
   - Discuss preventing talking-heads syndrome, using beats to show rather than tell

7. 🎲 **Creative Variations** (3-5 distinct approaches)
   **Show complete beat choreography variations, not dialogue rewrites**

   Select a static dialogue exchange and add beats 3-5 different ways:
   - **Variation A - [Approach]:** [Same dialogue with sparse, subtle beats]
     - **Rationale:** [How this beat density creates specific pacing/mood]
   - **Variation B - [Approach]:** [Same dialogue with denser, more physical beats]
     - **Rationale:** [How this beat density creates specific pacing/mood]

8. 🎨 **Variation Beat Palettes**
   - For each variation, list 2-4 key beat types that define that approach
   - Example: "Variation A uses micro-gestures (finger taps, eye shifts), creates intimate tension"

9. ❓ **Questions** (If needed)
   - About setting details, available props, spatial relationships, character physical habits
