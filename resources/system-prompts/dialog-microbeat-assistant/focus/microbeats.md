# ANALYSIS FOCUS: Action Beats and Physical Grounding

For this analysis, prioritize microbeat suggestions:

## PRIMARY EMPHASIS (80% of suggestions)
- **Breaking up long dialogue sequences**: Add physical action to prevent talking-heads syndrome
- **Physical grounding and setting details**: Anchor dialogue in space with gesture, movement, and environment
- **Pacing variety through action**: Use beats to control tempo and create dramatic pauses
- **Showing character state via movement**: Reveal emotion, intention, and relationships through physicality
- **Preventing static dialogue**: Give characters bodies and spatial relationships

## SECONDARY (20% of suggestions)
- **Dialogue issues**: ONLY where they directly impact beat placement or pacing
- Keep dialogue critique minimal and structural (e.g., "This line is too long to deliver without a breath")

## Creative Variations Focus
Your 🎲 **Creative Variations** section should explore:
- Different beat types (gesture, posture, spatial moves, object interaction)
- Variations in beat density (heavy vs. sparse)
- Different physical actions that convey the same emotional state
- Pacing rhythms (where to place beats for maximum dramatic impact)

Avoid line rewrites in this section—focus on the physical and spatial choreography.
