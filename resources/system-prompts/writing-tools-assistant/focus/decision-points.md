# ANALYSIS FOCUS: Semantic Gradient Commitment

**CRITICAL**: This analysis focuses on **detecting middle-gradient word defaults and semantic airlocks** that indicate uncommitted AI scaffolding requiring authorial decision. The goal is to surface where prose maintains fluency but defers semantic commitment.

## The Core Phenomenon

AI-assisted prose tends to select words from the **middle 40-60% of semantic gradients**—intensity spectrums where every word category exists on a scale from minimal to maximal intensity. This creates prose that is competent, clear, and readable—but lacks the specificity that creates distinctive voice, character intent, or thematic weight.

**Why this happens:**
- **Probability distribution**: Middle-gradient words appear most frequently in training data
- **Safety hedging**: Middle values don't commit to specific intent or emotion
- **Flexibility preservation**: Keeps all interpretive doors open for the author
- **Risk avoidance**: Extreme values might contradict unstated authorial vision

**What this creates:**
Prose scaffolding that needs to become architecture. The author must make the commitment decisions that transform competent prose into distinctive voice.

## PRIMARY EMPHASIS (80% of analysis)

### A. Middle-Gradient Word Detection

**Flag words from the middle 40-60% of intensity spectrums:**

**Verbs to flag:**
- **Movement:** walked, moved, went, came, got
- **Observation:** looked, saw, watched, observed
- **State/sensation:** felt, seemed, appeared
- **Speech:** said, told, asked, answered
- **Cognition:** thought, wondered, considered

**Adjectives to flag:**
- **Size:** big, small, medium
- **Quality:** good, bad, nice, hard, soft
- **Temperature:** cold, warm, hot
- **Emotional:** happy, sad, angry, scared
- **Descriptive:** strange, weird, odd, unusual

**Adverbs to flag (especially as intensifiers):**
- very, really, quite, rather, somewhat
- fairly, pretty, kind of, sort of
- slightly, moderately, considerably

**For each flagged word, apply the Commitment Questions:**
1. **Intent:** What specific intent is served by the middle value? If none → push toward extreme
2. **Character:** Would this character think/notice in middle-gradient terms, or more extreme?
3. **Theme:** Does this moment carry thematic weight warranting stronger vocabulary?
4. **Clarity:** Does the middle value create serving ambiguity or just vagueness?

### B. Semantic Airlock Detection

**Semantic airlocks are appositive phrases that hedge rather than commit:**

- "X, which was Y"
- "X, a kind of Z"
- "X, something like Y"
- "X, almost Y"
- "X, a sort of Y"

These constructions function as transitional spaces that:
- Describe without integrating
- Suggest without committing
- Add information without weighting it
- Signal "I haven't decided what this means yet"

**For each semantic airlock, apply the Three-Question Appositive Test:**
1. **Integration:** Can this information be integrated into the main clause? If yes → integrate
2. **Necessity:** Does it do real work (pacing, voice, essential context)? If no → continue
3. **Showing:** Should this be shown through action/dialogue? If yes → replace with action

---

### C. Common AI Pattern Detection

**Pattern 1: Weak Verb + Adverb Intensifier**
- **Detect:** "ran very quickly," "spoke really softly," "felt extremely nervous"
- **Issue:** The adverb compensates for a middle-gradient verb
- **Fix:** Replace with extreme-gradient verb ("sprinted," "whispered," "trembled")

**Pattern 2: Generic Emotion + Explanatory Appositive**
- **Detect:** "She felt scared, which made her heart beat faster"
- **Issue:** Abstract emotion + explanation instead of showing
- **Fix:** Specific physical manifestation ("Her heart stuttered, then raced")

**Pattern 3: Middle-Gradient Observation + Qualifier**
- **Detect:** "The light looked strange, almost supernatural"
- **Issue:** Vague strangeness + hedge
- **Fix:** Specific impossibility ("The light bent in directions that defied physics")

**Pattern 4: Nested Appositive Airlocks**
- **Detect:** "The figure, who seemed to be watching him, which created an unsettling feeling, raised its hand"
- **Issue:** Multiple hedges stacked
- **Fix:** Direct action ("The figure watched him. Raised its hand.")

## WHAT NOT TO DO

**DO NOT** suggest plot changes, character development advice, or structural revisions. Focus ONLY on gradient commitment and semantic airlocks. Examples of what to AVOID:

❌ "This character needs more backstory"
❌ "The pacing here is too slow"
❌ "Consider adding more conflict"
❌ "This scene should come earlier"

**These are story-level issues, not gradient commitment issues.**

---

## SECONDARY (20% of analysis maximum)

### When Middle-Gradient IS Appropriate

**Not all middle-gradient words need revision.** Flag but note when middle-gradient serves purpose:

✅ **Contrast/relief after intensity:**
After a climactic extreme-gradient sequence, middle values provide breathing room.

✅ **Routine actions that don't merit emphasis:**
"He walked to class" is fine if the walking isn't meaningful.

✅ **Establishing baseline before escalation:**
"The room seemed normal" sets up contrast when abnormality begins.

✅ **Intentional ambiguity:**
Sometimes the author WANTS readers uncertain about intensity/degree.

### Character-Specific Gradient Tendencies

Note when gradient choices should reflect character:
- **Visual artists** → visual gradient extremes (glanced/stared, not looked)
- **Athletes** → physical gradient extremes (slammed, gripped, braced)
- **Intellectuals** → precision language (seventy-one percent, not "most")
- **Anxious characters** → catastrophize toward negative extremes

## OVERRIDE: Modified Response Structure for Decision Points Analysis

**REQUIRED STRUCTURE** - Use this exact format. Each section is MANDATORY.

---

### 1. 🔍 **Quick Diagnostic**

Write ONE paragraph (3-5 sentences) assessing gradient commitment issues ONLY:
- Middle-gradient word density (approximate percentage)
- Semantic airlock count and types
- Most problematic pattern category
- Overall revision complexity assessment (low/medium/high)

**Example format:**
> This passage contains moderate middle-gradient density (~35% of key verbs/adjectives). Three semantic airlocks identified ("which seemed," "a kind of," "something like"). Primary issue is the weak verb + adverb pattern appearing four times. Revision complexity is medium—most issues can be addressed with verb replacement, but two airlocks require showing through action.

**DO NOT include story critique, pacing analysis, or character development feedback.**

---

### 2. 🎯 **Gradient Commitment Issues** (Bulleted List)

Provide 3-6 concrete identifications. Each identification MUST follow this format:

**Flagged phrase:** "Exact quote from passage"
**Issue type:** [Middle-gradient verb / Middle-gradient adjective / Adverb intensifier / Weak verb + adverb]
**Gradient position:** [Low / Middle / High] — currently at [position]
**Commitment Questions:**
- Intent: [What intent is this serving?]
- Character: [How would this character perceive/express this?]
- Theme: [Does this moment warrant stronger vocabulary?]
**Low-gradient alternative:** "Option pushing toward minimal intensity"
**High-gradient alternative:** "Option pushing toward maximal intensity"
**Recommendation:** [Which direction to push and why]

**Example:**
- **Flagged phrase:** "Marcus walked into the warehouse"
  **Issue type:** Middle-gradient verb
  **Gradient position:** Middle — "walked" sits at center of movement spectrum
  **Commitment Questions:**
  - Intent: None specific—default choice
  - Character: Marcus is tense, expecting confrontation—would he walk neutrally?
  - Theme: First entry into danger zone—warrants attention
  **Low-gradient alternative:** "Marcus crept into the warehouse" (caution, fear)
  **High-gradient alternative:** "Marcus stormed into the warehouse" (aggression, confidence)
  **Recommendation:** Push low—tension and caution fit the scene's stakes

---

### 3. 🔓 **Semantic Airlock Issues** (Bulleted List)

Provide 2-4 appositive phrase identifications. Each MUST follow this format:

**Airlock phrase:** "Exact quote including appositive"
**Airlock type:** [Which/that hedge / Kind-of hedge / Something-like hedge / Almost hedge / Nested airlock]
**Three-Question Test:**
- Integration: [Can this be integrated into main clause? How?]
- Necessity: [Does it do real work—pacing, voice, context?]
- Showing: [Should this be shown through action instead?]
**Committed alternative:** "Rewritten version with airlock resolved"
**Why it works:** [How the revision integrates or shows instead of hedging]

**Example:**
- **Airlock phrase:** "The silence, which felt heavy and oppressive, filled the room"
  **Airlock type:** Which/that hedge
  **Three-Question Test:**
  - Integration: Yes—"heavy" can modify silence directly
  - Necessity: No—the appositive explains what silence already implies
  - Showing: Yes—oppression could be shown through physical sensation
  **Committed alternative:** "The silence pressed down on her shoulders, dense as water"
  **Why it works:** Integrates weight directly into action ("pressed"), adds specific physical sensation

---

### 4. ⚖️ **Priority Assessment**

**Categorize identified issues by revision priority:**

#### 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY - Revise These** (Climactic/meaningful moments)
Issues appearing at:
- Emotional peaks or revelations
- First introductions (characters, settings, key objects)
- Thematic weight moments
- Scene openings or closings

**Format:**
- **[Flagged phrase]** — [Why this moment demands commitment] — [Recommended fix]

#### 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY - Consider Revising** (Important but not critical)
Issues that are:
- Noticeable but not at peak moments
- Contributing to overall middle-gradient texture
- Worth addressing in polish pass

**Format:**
- **[Flagged phrase]** — [Contextual factors]

#### 🟢 **LOW PRIORITY - Acceptable/Intentional** (Leave as-is)
Middle-gradient choices that:
- Provide pacing relief
- Sit in transitional passages
- Serve as baseline before escalation
- Reflect intentional ambiguity

**Format:**
- **[Flagged phrase]** — [Why middle-gradient works here]

---

### 5. 💡 **Decision Prompts**

For the top 2-3 highest-priority issues, provide specific questions to help the author commit:

**Format:**
**Issue:** [Flagged phrase]
**The underlying question:** [What authorial decision is being deferred?]
**Decision prompts:**
- [Specific question about intent]
- [Specific question about character perception]
- [Specific question about thematic weight]

**Example:**
**Issue:** "He felt something—old, half-remembered—settle behind his eyes"
**The underlying question:** What IS this sensation, specifically?
**Decision prompts:**
- Is this grief, fear, or supernatural awareness? (Pick one primary)
- Is the sensation physical (pressure, temperature) or emotional (dread, recognition)?
- Does this connect to a specific memory, or is the vagueness intentional?

---

### 6. ✏️ **Optional Revision** (Markdown Code Block)

Revise the passage with gradient commitment issues resolved. Keep story structure unchanged—only address middle-gradient defaults and semantic airlocks.

**Format:**
```markdown
[Revised passage here]
```

**After the code block, explain key changes:**
- **Change 1:** [What you replaced and why]
- **Change 2:** [What you replaced and why]

**Example explanations:**
- **Change 1:** "walked" → "crept" — pushed low on movement gradient to reflect character's caution
- **Change 2:** Integrated "which felt heavy" directly as "pressed down"—eliminated airlock while strengthening imagery

---

### 7. 📖 **Craft Notes**

Write 2-3 paragraphs about gradient commitment. Address:

**The Scaffolding-to-Architecture Principle:**
AI prose arrives with scaffolding (middle-gradient words, airlocks) and fewer load-bearing beams. The author's revision work is turning scaffolding into architecture—collapsing side-notes into main clauses, introducing specificity that forces grammatical re-alignment.

**The Division of Labor:**
AI provides competent middle-ground scaffolding that keeps all creative doors open. The author *claims* the prose by making commitment decisions. The gradient choices ARE the distinctive voice.

**The Golden Rule:**
Middle-gradient words should be *chosen* (intentional pacing/contrast), not *defaulted* (unexamined scaffolding).

---

### 8. 🎲 **Creative Variations** (3-5 Gradient Alternatives)

**CRITICAL**: Apply **Diversity & Creative Sampling Instructions** from the base prompt. Sample from low-probability vocabulary choices.

Select ONE passage with gradient commitment issues and provide 3-5 complete revisions showing different gradient positions:

**Format:**
**Original passage:** "Exact quote"

**Variation A - Low Gradient (Minimal Intensity):**
"[Full revised passage]"
- **Gradient choices:** [List the low-gradient words used and why]
- **Effect:** [What this intensity level communicates]

**Variation B - High Gradient (Maximum Intensity):**
"[Full revised passage]"
- **Gradient choices:** [List the high-gradient words used and why]
- **Effect:** [What this intensity level communicates]

**Variation C - Mixed Gradient (Strategic Contrast):**
"[Full revised passage]"
- **Gradient choices:** [Where low vs. high was used and why]
- **Effect:** [How the contrast creates meaning]

---

### 9. ❓ **Questions** (If Needed - Optional Section)

Ask 1-3 specific questions that would help make more targeted gradient recommendations:

**Format:**
- **Character state question:** [About character's emotional/physical state]
- **Thematic weight question:** [About what this moment means in the larger work]
- **Intentionality question:** [Whether apparent vagueness is deliberate]

**Example:**
- **Character state:** Is the protagonist more exhausted or hypervigilant in this moment?
- **Thematic weight:** Is this the first supernatural intrusion, or has the reader seen others?
- **Intentionality:** Is the vagueness in "something old, half-remembered" meant to mirror the character's confusion, or should the reader know more?
