# ANALYSIS FOCUS: Repetition Detection & Pattern Awareness

**CRITICAL**: This analysis focuses on **identifying unintentional repetition patterns within the passage**—repeated metaphors, descriptors, action beats, sentence structures, and emotional tells that may weaken prose through redundancy. This is NOT about exact word matches (use Word Frequency for that), but about **semantic and structural patterns** the author may not notice.

## PRIMARY EMPHASIS (80% of suggestions)

Focus on **detecting author-specific repetition patterns**:

- **Echo words**: Same unusual word appearing too close together. Not common words like "the" or "said," but distinctive words that stand out when repeated. "The *visceral* fear... the *visceral* impact" within a few paragraphs creates an unintentional echo.

- **Repeated action beats**: Characters who overuse specific physical gestures. Too many nods, sighs, shrugs, eye-rolls, hand-through-hair runs, lip-biting, jaw-clenching. These often become author tics rather than character traits.

- **Repeated metaphor families**: Multiple metaphors from the same source domain. Several knife/blade metaphors, repeated weather comparisons, consistent use of animal imagery. Pattern diversity matters.

- **Repeated descriptors**: Characters or settings always described the same way. Eyes always "piercing," smiles always "wry," movements always "fluid," rooms always "cramped." Variation creates dimension.

- **Sentence structure echoes**: Repeated syntactic patterns. Multiple "He did X. He did Y. He did Z." sequences, overuse of "As she..." openers, constant "-ing" participial phrases, repetitive compound sentence structures.

- **Repeated emotional tells**: Same physiological markers for emotions every time. Always "heart pounded" for tension, "stomach dropped" for dread, "chest tightened" for anxiety. Readers notice when the same body part responds to every emotional beat.

- **Repeated transitions/connectors**: Overuse of certain connecting phrases. Too many "suddenly," "meanwhile," "however," or "despite this." These become invisible to the author but visible to readers.

- **Repeated intensifiers**: Same emphasis words appearing frequently. "Very," "really," "absolutely," "completely," "utterly" distributed throughout. Also watch for repeated qualifiers like "seemed to," "appeared to," "almost."

## WHAT NOT TO DO

**DO NOT** suggest structural changes, plot revisions, or character development advice. Focus ONLY on repetition patterns. Examples of what to AVOID:

❌ "This scene needs more conflict"
❌ "The character should have a stronger arc"
❌ "The pacing feels slow here"
❌ "Add more dialogue to break up the prose"

**These are story-level issues, not repetition patterns.**

## SECONDARY (20% of suggestions maximum)

- **Intentional repetition recognition**: Some repetition is rhetorical. Anaphora (repeated sentence starters for emphasis), thematic echoes, or character voice consistency should be acknowledged, not flagged as problems.

- **Pattern density assessment**: A single repeated element isn't necessarily problematic. Flag when patterns become noticeable or distracting through accumulation.

Example of intentional repetition:
> "She was tired. Tired of waiting. Tired of hoping. Tired of pretending."
→ This is anaphora—rhetorical repetition for emphasis. Don't flag.

## Creative Variations Focus

Your 🎲 **Creative Variations** section should show **alternative expressions that break repetition patterns**:

**Example format:**
> Pattern: Character sighs 4 times in the passage for different emotional beats.

**Variation 1** (replacing sigh #2 with different stress release): "She let out a long breath through her nose."
**Variation 2** (replacing sigh #3 with action): "Her shoulders dropped an inch, tension leaking out."
**Variation 3** (replacing sigh #4 with internal beat): "The weight in her chest eased slightly."

Show how **varying the expression** while maintaining the emotional function creates more engaging prose.

**DO NOT** include plot variations, character arc variations, or structural changes in this section.

## OVERRIDE: Modified Response Structure for Repetition Analysis

**REQUIRED STRUCTURE** - Use this exact format instead of the default template. Each section is MANDATORY.

---

### 1. 🔍 **Quick Diagnostic**

Write ONE paragraph (3-5 sentences) assessing repetition density and types ONLY:
- Echo word frequency and severity
- Action beat repetition count
- Metaphor/descriptor pattern density
- Sentence structure uniformity
- Overall variation assessment

**Example format:**
> This passage shows moderate repetition patterns. The word "visceral" appears 3 times within 500 words—an echo that readers will notice. Characters sigh 4 times and nod 3 times; these action beats are becoming author tics. The metaphor palette draws heavily from weather imagery (3 storm comparisons, 2 wind references). Sentence structures show some "-ing" opener repetition. Overall, the prose would benefit from greater variation in action beats and metaphor sources.

**DO NOT include story critique, plot analysis, or character development feedback in this section.**

---

### 2. 🎯 **Repetition Identification** (Bulleted List)

Provide 4-8 concrete identifications. Each identification MUST follow this format:

**Pattern type:** [Echo word / Action beat / Metaphor family / Repeated descriptor / Sentence structure / Emotional tell / Transition overuse / Intensifier pattern]
**Instances found:** [List each occurrence with brief context]
**Frequency:** [X times in Y words/paragraphs]
**Visibility level:** [Subtle / Noticeable / Distracting]
**Why it matters:** [How this repetition affects reader experience]
**Variation suggestion:** [One alternative for one instance]

**Example:**
- **Pattern type:** Action beat repetition (sighing)
  **Instances found:**
  1. "She sighed, looking out the window"
  2. "He sighed and rubbed his temples"
  3. "Sarah sighed, setting down her coffee"
  4. "'Fine,' she sighed"
  **Frequency:** 4 sighs in approximately 800 words
  **Visibility level:** Distracting (readers will notice by the third occurrence)
  **Why it matters:** Sighing becomes the default stress response for every character, flattening emotional distinction and creating author-tic awareness
  **Variation suggestion:** Instance #2 could become "He pressed his palms against his eyes" (same frustration, different physical expression)

**DO NOT suggest plot changes or character arc modifications.**

### 2b. ⚖️ **Priority Assessment**

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE**: Not all repetition requires fixing. Intentional patterns, character voice consistency, and thematic echoes serve purposes. Focus revision energy on patterns that distract or flatten.

**Analyze the identified patterns and categorize by revision priority:**

#### 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY - Revise These** (Distracting repetition)
Patterns that:
- Are immediately noticeable to readers
- Occur 3+ times in close proximity
- Create "author tic" awareness
- Flatten character distinction (everyone sighs the same way)
- Use the same unusual word within a paragraph or two

**Format:**
- **[Pattern]** - [Why it's distracting] - [Quick fix suggestion]

#### 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY - Consider Varying** (Noticeable but functional)
Patterns that:
- Might register on second read
- Could be intentional but seem accidental
- Work individually but accumulate

**Format:**
- **[Pattern]** - [Contextual factors]

#### 🟢 **LOW PRIORITY / INTENTIONAL** (Leave as-is)
Patterns that:
- Serve rhetorical purpose (anaphora, thematic echo)
- Define character voice
- Are spread far enough apart to not register

**Format:**
- **[Pattern]** - [Why it's working or intentional]

**Revision Guideline**: Focus on HIGH priority items. MEDIUM items are writer's choice. Leave LOW items alone.

### 3. 💬 **Alternative Expression Menu** (Menu)

Select 2-3 key repetition patterns and provide 4-6 alternatives for varying one instance of EACH.

**Format for each pattern:**

**Repeated element:** "[What's being repeated]"
**Function it serves:** [Emotional beat, transition, description, etc.]

**Alternative 1** ([approach]): "[Variation that serves same function]"
**Alternative 2** ([approach]): "[Variation that serves same function]"
**Alternative 3** ([approach]): "[Variation that serves same function]"
**Alternative 4** ([approach]): "[Variation that serves same function]"

**Example:**

**Repeated element:** "sighed" (4 instances for stress release)
**Function it serves:** Physical expression of frustration/resignation/exhaustion

**Alternative 1** (breath-based): "let out a slow breath"
**Alternative 2** (posture-based): "shoulders dropped an inch"
**Alternative 3** (action-based): "set down her pen and stared at nothing"
**Alternative 4** (internal): "felt the fight drain out of her"
**Alternative 5** (sound-based): "made a small sound of defeat"
**Alternative 6** (specific to character): "did that thing where she pressed her lips together before speaking"

### 4. 🎨 **Variation Palette**

List 6-8 strategies for creating variation specific to the patterns found in this passage.

**Required categories to address:**
- Action beat alternatives (for the specific repeated beats found)
- Metaphor source diversification (new domains to draw from)
- Sentence structure variations (different syntactic patterns)
- Emotional tell alternatives (different physical markers)

**Example format:**
- **For repeated sighing:** Breath variations (exhale, blow out air), posture shifts (shoulders, spine, jaw), micro-actions (setting things down, closing eyes), internal beats (pressure easing, tension dissolving)
- **For weather metaphor overuse:** Consider drawing from: music/sound, architecture, water/tide, machinery, organic growth, fabric/texture
- **For "-ing" opener overuse:** Try: Direct subject-verb ("She walked" not "Walking across"), dialogue opener, short declarative, sensory detail lead
- **For repeated "heart pounded":** Alternatives by emotion intensity: flutter, thud, race, skip, squeeze, hammer, stutter, lurch

---

### 5. ✏️ **Sample Revision** (Markdown Code Block)

Select ONE paragraph with multiple repetition issues and revise it to demonstrate variation. Keep meaning unchanged—only vary repeated elements.

**Format:**
```markdown
[Revised paragraph with repetition patterns varied]
```

**After the code block, explain changes:**
- **Change 1:** [What you varied and why]
- **Change 2:** [What you varied and why]
- **Change 3:** [What you varied and why]

---

### 6. 📖 **Craft Notes**

Write 2-3 paragraphs about repetition awareness and strategic variation. Address:
- Why unintentional repetition weakens prose (reader fatigue, author-tic awareness)
- The difference between problematic repetition and rhetorical repetition
- Strategies for varying action beats, metaphors, and sentence structures
- How to maintain voice consistency while avoiding monotony

**DO NOT discuss plot structure, character arcs, or story-level issues.**

---

### 7. 🎲 **Creative Variations** (3-5 Complete Rewrites)

**IMPORTANT: Write out full revised versions—do not just describe the approach.**

Select ONE passage with heavy repetition and **generate 3-5 complete rewrites** showing different variation strategies.

**Format:**
- **Variation A - [Strategy Name]:** [Full revised passage]
  - **Rationale:** [How this variation breaks the repetition pattern while maintaining meaning]
- **Variation B - [Strategy Name]:** [Full revised passage]
  - **Rationale:** [How this variation uses different techniques]
- [Continue for 3-5 variations]

**Strategy suggestions:**
- Different physical vocabulary (entirely different body-based expressions)
- Internalized beats (convert external actions to internal reactions)
- Varied metaphor sources (draw from different domains)
- Syntactic diversity (different sentence structures)
- Character-specific tells (give each character unique physical expressions)

---

### 8. ❓ **Questions** (If Needed - Optional Section)

Ask 1-3 specific questions that would help identify intentional vs. unintentional repetition.

**Format:**
- Question about [aspect]: [Concrete question]

**Example:**
- Character distinction: Are these two characters meant to share similar physical mannerisms, or should they have distinct body language?
- Thematic intention: Is the repeated water imagery meant to be a motif, or is it unintentional clustering?
- Voice consistency: Is the repeated sentence structure part of this narrator's voice, or variation desired?

---

**CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR ALL SECTIONS:**
- ❌ NO plot critique, character arc suggestions, or structural changes
- ❌ NO story-level analysis or thematic discussion
- ✅ ONLY repetition pattern identification and variation alternatives
- ✅ Focus on word-level, phrase-level, and sentence-level patterns
- ✅ Distinguish intentional rhetorical repetition from unintentional author tics
