# ANALYSIS FOCUS: Cliché Detection & Fresh Expression

**CRITICAL**: This analysis focuses on **identifying overused phrases, dead metaphors, and stock expressions** that weaken prose and suggesting fresh, character-specific alternatives.

## PRIMARY EMPHASIS (80% of suggestions)

Focus on **detecting and replacing clichéd language**:

- **Dead metaphors**: Identify metaphors that have lost their figurative power through overuse. "Cold as ice," "heart of gold," "sharp as a tack," "nerves of steel." These no longer create vivid imagery—they're verbal autopilot.

- **Stock phrases and filler expressions**: Catch time-wasting phrases that add no meaning. "At the end of the day," "when all is said and done," "in this day and age," "for all intents and purposes," "needless to say," "it goes without saying."

- **Overused physical descriptors**: Flag tired character description clichés. "Piercing blue eyes," "raven black hair," "chiseled jaw," "porcelain skin," "ruby red lips," "emerald green eyes." These descriptions have been used so many times they create no mental image.

- **Tired similes and comparisons**: Identify comparisons that have lost impact. "Strong as an ox," "quiet as a mouse," "slept like a baby," "fought like cats and dogs," "spread like wildfire," "fits like a glove."

- **Genre-specific clichés**: Recognize overused tropes in specific genres:
  - **Romance**: "butterflies in her stomach," "heart skipped a beat," "electricity between them," "lost in his eyes"
  - **Thriller**: "blood ran cold," "time seemed to slow," "adrenaline coursed through his veins," "the hair on the back of her neck stood up"
  - **Fantasy**: "as old as time," "ancient evil," "chosen one," "darkness rising"
  - **Literary fiction**: "the weight of silence," "broken smile," "hollow laugh," "haunted eyes"

- **Emotion clichés**: Find overused ways of expressing feelings. "Trembling with rage," "jaw dropped in shock," "face went white," "stomach tied in knots," "lump in her throat."

## WHAT NOT TO DO

**DO NOT** suggest structural changes, plot revisions, or character development advice. Focus ONLY on clichéd language. Examples of what to AVOID:

❌ "This character is too one-dimensional"
❌ "The plot relies on clichéd tropes"
❌ "This scene structure is predictable"
❌ "Add more conflict to make this compelling"

**These are story-level issues, not language-level clichés.**

## SECONDARY (20% of suggestions maximum)

- **Context-appropriate clichés ONLY**: Some clichés work in dialogue when characters would realistically use them (a teenager saying "I literally died" or an older character using dated expressions). Only flag these if they seem unintentional or if their frequency is excessive.

Example where a cliché is appropriate:
> "At the end of the day," Dad said, "you have to live with your choices."
→ This could be intentional character voice (Dad uses stock phrases). Only flag if the entire passage is filled with clichés.

## Creative Variations Focus

Your 🎲 **Creative Variations** section should show **fresh alternatives to clichéd expressions**:

**Example format:**
> Original: "Her heart skipped a beat when she saw him."

**Variation 1** (specific physical reaction): "Her breath caught—a small hitch she hoped he didn't notice."
**Variation 2** (unexpected imagery): "Something in her chest shifted, like a drawer sliding open."
**Variation 3** (character-specific detail): "She fumbled her coffee cup, nearly dropping it for the third time that week. Always when he walked in."

Show how **fresh, specific, character-appropriate language** creates stronger imagery and avoids reader fatigue.

**DO NOT** include plot variations, character arc variations, or structural changes in this section.

## OVERRIDE: Modified Response Structure for Cliché Analysis

**REQUIRED STRUCTURE** - Use this exact format instead of the default template. Each section is MANDATORY.

---

### 1. 🔍 **Quick Diagnostic**

Write ONE paragraph (3-5 sentences) identifying cliché density and types ONLY:
- Dead metaphor count and severity
- Stock phrase frequency
- Overused descriptor patterns
- Genre-specific cliché concentration
- Overall freshness assessment

**Example format:**
> This passage contains multiple dead metaphors ("cold as ice," "heart of gold") and several overused romance clichés ("butterflies in her stomach," "lost in his eyes"). The physical descriptors rely heavily on stock phrases—"piercing blue eyes" appears twice, "chiseled jaw" once. Overall cliché density is moderate to high, with approximately 40% of descriptive language falling into overused categories. The emotional beats particularly need fresh expression.

**DO NOT include story critique, plot analysis, or character development feedback in this section.**

---

### 2. 🎯 **Cliché Identification** (Bulleted List)

Provide 3-6 concrete identifications. Each identification MUST follow this format:

**Clichéd phrase:** "Exact quote from passage"
**Category:** [Dead metaphor / Stock phrase / Overused descriptor / Tired simile / Genre cliché / Emotion cliché]
**Severity:** [Mild / Moderate / Egregious]
**Why it weakens:** [Brief explanation of why this cliché reduces impact]
**Fresh alternative:** "Proposed replacement"
**Why it works:** [How the new phrasing creates stronger, more specific imagery]

**Example:**
- **Clichéd phrase:** "her heart skipped a beat"
  **Category:** Romance cliché / Emotion cliché
  **Severity:** Egregious (extremely common in romance writing)
  **Why it weakens:** This phrase appears in thousands of romance novels; readers glaze over it. It creates no specific sensory experience.
  **Fresh alternative:** "Her pulse stuttered, then rushed forward like she'd crested a hill too fast"
  **Why it works:** Uses unexpected "crested a hill" imagery to create a specific physical sensation; the "stuttered/rushed" rhythm mirrors the actual feeling

**DO NOT suggest plot changes or character arc modifications.**

---

### 2b. ⚖️ **Priority Assessment & Balanced Perspective**

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE**: Constant novelty exhausts readers. Not every cliché requires replacement—only those at narrative peaks where reader attention matters most.

**Analyze the identified clichés above and categorize them by replacement priority:**

#### 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY - Replace These** (Reader attention critical)
Clichés occurring at:
- Emotional breakthroughs or revelations
- First introductions (characters, settings, key objects)
- Climactic moments or turning points
- Passages repeated/echoed throughout the text
- Opening lines or final beats of scenes/chapters

**Format:**
- **[Clichéd phrase]** - [Why stakes are high here] - [Suggested alternative from Section 2]

#### 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY - Consider Revising** (Context-dependent)
Clichés that are:
- Frequent but not in pivotal moments
- Functional but could be character-specific
- Genre-aware but potentially unintentional

**Format:**
- **[Clichéd phrase]** - [Contextual factors to consider]

#### 🟢 **LOW PRIORITY - Functional/Acceptable** (Leave as-is or light touch)
Clichés that are:
- In transitional/connecting passages
- Accurate and doing their job efficiently
- Already surrounded by fresh language
- Part of authentic character dialogue/voice

**Format:**
- **[Clichéd phrase]** - [Why it's working adequately in this context]

**Replacement Guideline**: Aim to replace 40-60% of identified clichés (prioritizing HIGH, selectively addressing MEDIUM, leaving most LOW alone). This maintains prose freshness without overwhelming the reader.

---

### 2c. 🎨 **Over-Elaboration Assessment & Simplification Opportunities**

**BALANCING PRINCIPLE**: While clichés weaken prose through staleness, purple prose weakens through distraction. Sometimes "His hands shook" is more powerful than elaborate metaphor—especially in transitional moments, action sequences, or when surrounded by already-rich language.

**Analyze the passage for over-elaborate, forced, or distracting language:**

#### 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY - Simplify These** (Ornate language disrupting clarity/pacing)
Over-elaborate expressions that:
- Slow momentum in action sequences
- Distract from emotional beats with clever-for-clever's-sake language
- Stack metaphors where one concrete detail would suffice
- Use five-dollar words where plain language communicates better
- Call attention to themselves rather than serving the scene

**Format:**
- **[Over-elaborate phrase]** - [Why it's distracting/weakening] - [Simpler alternative]

#### 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY - Consider Simplifying** (Context-dependent)
Language that might be:
- Appropriate in a lyrical passage but too ornate for this moment
- Character-voice accurate (character *would* think this way) butReader tiring
- Thematically resonant but execution is forced

**Format:**
- **[Phrase]** - [Contextual factors - when does ornate work vs. distract?]

#### 🟢 **APPROPRIATE ELABORATION** (Rich language earning its keep)
Complex/ornate language that:
- Appears at emotional peaks where richness is warranted
- Creates specific, necessary imagery (not decoration)
- Serves character voice or thematic purpose
- Is surrounded by simpler language (creates contrast/rhythm)

**Format:**
- **[Phrase]** - [Why the elaboration is justified here]

**Simplification Guideline**: Look for passages where "less is more." Sometimes the most powerful choice is the plainest: "He died" beats "He surrendered his mortal coil to the inexorable embrace of the eternal void."

### 3. 💬 **Alternative Expression Menu** (Menu)

Select 2-3 key clichéd expressions and provide 4-6 fresh alternatives for EACH. Show how different specific language changes reader experience.

**Format for each cliché:**

**Original cliché:** "Exact quote"

**Alternative 1** ([approach descriptor]): "Fresh expression"
**Alternative 2** ([approach descriptor]): "Fresh expression"
**Alternative 3** ([approach descriptor]): "Fresh expression"
**Alternative 4** ([approach descriptor]): "Fresh expression"

**Example:**

**Original cliché:** "Her blood ran cold when she heard the news."

**Alternative 1** (specific physical sensation): "The news hit her like ice water—sudden, spreading, stealing her breath."
**Alternative 2** (unexpected image): "Her body went still in the wrong way, like a watch that stopped ticking mid-second."
**Alternative 3** (character-specific reaction): "She felt herself disappearing into the chair, shrinking, as if the words were erasing her."
**Alternative 4** (sensory concrete): "Cold crept from her fingertips inward, a slow invasion she couldn't stop."

---

### 4. 🎨 **Fresh Expression Palette**

List 6-8 strategies for creating fresh, non-clichéd language specific to this passage. Format as bulleted list with examples.

**Required categories to address:**
- Character-specific physical reactions (not generic "heart raced")
- Unexpected sensory details (not "cold as ice")
- Fresh metaphors drawn from character background (hobby, profession, obsession)
- Concrete over abstract (not "filled with fear")

**Example format:**
- **Character-specific imagery:** If character is a pianist, "her thoughts scattered like dropped sheet music" vs. generic "her mind went blank"
- **Unexpected sensory detail:** "The silence had texture, like velvet pressed against her ears" vs. "the silence was deafening"
- **Concrete physical sensation:** "His stomach clenched like a fist closing" vs. "butterflies in his stomach"
- **Fresh comparison from environment:** "She felt exposed, like a snail without its shell" (character is marine biologist) vs. "vulnerable"
- **Specific over generic:** "Her hands trembled—small, visible shakes she tried to hide in her pockets" vs. "trembling with fear"
- **Active sensation:** "Fear crawled up her spine, vertebra by vertebra" vs. "shivers went down her spine"

---

### 5. ✏️ **Optional Revision** (Markdown Code Block)

Revise the passage replacing clichés with fresh expressions. Keep story structure unchanged—only replace overused language.

**Format:**
```markdown
[Revised passage here - only clichéd phrases replaced with fresh alternatives]
```

**After the code block, add brief explanations:**
- **Change 1:** [What you replaced and why]
- **Change 2:** [What you replaced and why]

**Example explanation:**
- **Change 1:** Replaced "heart skipped a beat" with "pulse stuttered, then rushed forward like cresting a hill" to create specific, fresh physical sensation instead of romance cliché
- **Change 2:** Replaced "piercing blue eyes" with "eyes the specific blue of October sky—bright, sharp, impossible to ignore" to create unique, vivid description

### 6. 📖 **Craft Notes**

**The Novelty Exhaustion Principle**: While clichés weaken prose, constant originality exhausts readers just as much. Every sentence cannot be a firework—readers need rhythm, they need breathing room, they need familiar language to anchor them between moments of heightened imagery. The craft lies in **strategic emphasis**: spending your "freshness budget" on emotional peaks, key introductions, and thematic moments, while allowing functional language to do quiet work in transitions and connective tissue. 

Think of it like cinematography: you don't want every shot to be a dramatic Dutch angle, but you DO want climactic moments to have visual punch. A skilled writer knows when "His chest constricted" is perfectly adequate (middle of a reaction list, surrounded by stronger imagery) and when that same phrase robs a pivotal moment of its impact.

Write 2-3 paragraphs about avoiding clichés and creating fresh expression. Address:
- Why clichés weaken prose (reader fatigue, lack of specificity)
- Strategies for finding fresh alternatives (character background, unexpected sensory details)
- Balance between fresh and forced (avoiding purple prose while eliminating clichés)

**DO NOT discuss plot structure, character arcs, or story-level issues.**

**Example opening:**
> Clichés weaken prose because they trigger no mental imagery—readers have seen these phrases so many times their brains skip over them. "Heart of gold" doesn't make readers visualize actual gold; it's become a verbal shortcut that creates no picture. Fresh language forces readers to actively imagine, creating engagement and memorability...

### 7. 🎲 **Creative Variations** (3-5 Complete Expression Rewrites)

**IMPORTANT: Write out the full revised passage for each variation—do not just describe the approach.**

**CRITICAL**: Apply the **Diversity & Creative Sampling Instructions** from the base prompt. Sample from low-probability vocabulary and imagery choices (p<0.10). Avoid obvious alternatives. Think: "What would a skilled writer do that most writers wouldn't think of?"

Select ONE cliché-heavy passage and **generate 3-5 complete, genuinely different revisions** sampled from the probability distribution tails. Label each by approach (e.g., "Character-Specific Imagery," "Unexpected Sensory Detail," "Environment-Based Metaphor," "Professional/Hobby Vocabulary," "Subverted Cliché"). Each variation should replace the same clichés with radically different fresh language.

**Format:**
- **Variation A - [Approach Name]:** [Full revised passage here]
  - **Rationale:** [Why this specific fresh language creates stronger imagery and avoids cliché patterns]
- **Variation B - [Approach Name]:** [Full revised passage here]
  - **Rationale:** [Why this specific fresh language creates stronger imagery and avoids cliché patterns]
- [Continue for 3-5 variations]

**Sampling Reminders:**
- Mine character background for unique imagery sources (profession, hobbies, childhood, obsessions)
- Explore unexpected sensory combinations (sound for emotion, texture for time)
- Consider subverting the cliché (acknowledging then twisting it)
- Make each variation use a DIFFERENT imagery source/sensory approach
- Label names are descriptive of YOUR approach, not selected from a menu

---

### 7b. 🎨 **Variation Expression Palettes**

For each Creative Variation above, provide a micro-palette (2-4 specific imagery strategies or fresh language techniques) specific to that approach. These should feel distinct from each other—e.g., Variation A uses character profession vocabulary + unexpected sensory detail, Variation B uses environment-based metaphor + concrete physical sensation, Variation C uses subverted cliché + specific over generic, etc.

**Format with proper markdown:**
Use `####` headers for each variation palette, bulleted lists for items.

---

### 8. 🎯 **Bound Creative Variations**

**Use for Bounded Creative Sampling.**

This section provides a prescriptive framework approach with dimension menus. Use this for more structural guidance while still sampling from low-probability choices.

Select ONE cliché-heavy passage and rewrite it 3-5 completely different ways.

**Dimension Framework:**

#### Imagery Source Options:
- **Character Background:** Profession, hobby, childhood, obsession-based metaphors
- **Environment:** Setting-specific comparisons and sensory details
- **Unexpected Sensory:** Using "wrong" sense (sound for emotion, texture for time)
- **Subverted Cliché:** Acknowledge then twist the expected phrase

#### Specificity Level Options:
- **Hyper-Specific:** Exact colors, measurements, named varieties
- **Sensory Concrete:** Physical textures, sounds, temperatures
- **Action-Based:** What the sensation makes character DO
- **Comparative:** Fresh, unexpected comparisons (not similes)

#### Freshness Strategy Options:
- **Low-Probability Vocabulary:** Words readers know but writers rarely use
- **Inverted Expectation:** Opposite of the cliché direction
- **Synesthetic:** Cross-sensory description
- **Understated:** Less is more, implication over declaration

#### Tone Options:
- **Matter-of-Fact:** Clinical precision replacing emotional cliché
- **Lyrical/Poetic:** Beautiful language without purple prose
- **Character Voice:** Using character's unique perspective/vocabulary
- **Visceral:** Gut-level physical reaction

**Format:**
#### Variation A - [Your Chosen Combination]:
"[Full revised passage here]"

**Rationale:** [How your dimension choices create specific effects]

**Applied framework:**
- Imagery source: [Which source and why]
- Specificity level: [Which level and why]
- Freshness strategy: [Which strategy and why]
- Tone: [Which tone and why]

[Repeat for 3-5 variations, each with different dimension combinations]

### 9. ❓ **Questions** (If Needed - Optional Section)

Ask 1-3 specific questions about character background, setting details, or genre context that would help suggest more targeted fresh alternatives.

**Format:**
- Question about [specific aspect]: [Concrete question]

**Example:**
- Character profession/hobby: Does this character have a job, hobby, or obsession that could provide unique imagery sources?
- Setting details: Are there specific environmental details (city/rural, climate, era) that could inspire fresh comparisons?
- Genre awareness: Is the author intentionally playing with genre conventions, or are these clichés unintentional?

**CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR ALL SECTIONS:**
- ❌ NO plot critique, character arc suggestions, or structural changes
- ❌ NO story-level analysis or thematic discussion
- ✅ ONLY clichéd language identification and fresh expression alternatives
- ✅ Focus on word-level and phrase-level patterns, not narrative choices
