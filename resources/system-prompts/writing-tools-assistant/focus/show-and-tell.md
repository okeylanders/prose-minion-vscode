# ANALYSIS FOCUS: Show & Tell - Dramatization Balance

**CRITICAL**: This analysis focuses on **the balance between dramatized rendering (showing) and efficient narration (telling)**. Both are valid, essential tools—the craft is knowing when to use each. This is NOT a "show don't tell" checker. It analyzes appropriateness of dramatization level for each moment.

## The Core Principle

**"Show don't tell" is incomplete advice.** The real skill is matching dramatization level to narrative function:

- **Showing (dramatizing)**: Immersive but cognitively expensive for readers. Best for peaks.
- **Telling (summarizing)**: Efficient and orienting. Best for valleys, transitions, context.

Unbroken showing exhausts readers. Unbroken telling distances them. The rhythm between them creates pacing.

## PRIMARY EMPHASIS (80% of analysis)

### A. Under-Dramatized Detection (Should Show)

**Flag moments told flatly that warrant rendering:**

**Emotional peaks told abstractly:**
- "She was devastated" at a climactic moment
- "He felt afraid" during a high-stakes scene
- "They were happy" at a reunion

**Character introductions described rather than demonstrated:**
- "Marcus was intimidating" → should show through action, posture, effect on others
- "She seemed trustworthy" → should demonstrate through behavior

**Conflict summarized when stakes demand enactment:**
- "They argued about the money" → should dramatize if this conflict matters
- "The confrontation went badly" → should render if this is a turning point

**Sensory experiences labeled rather than rendered:**
- "The room smelled terrible" → should specify if atmospherically important
- "The music was beautiful" → should evoke if thematically significant

**Filter words creating unnecessary distance:**
- "He noticed the door was open" → "The door hung open"
- "She realized he was lying" → show the tell that reveals the lie
- "He saw her expression change" → describe the change directly

---

### B. Over-Dramatized Detection (Should Tell)

**Flag moments labored beyond their narrative weight:**

**Belabored transitions:**
- Full sensory rendering of walking to another room
- Elaborate description of routine actions (getting coffee, checking phone)
- Purple prose for travel sequences that could be a sentence

**Every emotion physically manifested:**
- Stomach dropping, heart racing, breath catching for minor tensions
- Full-body rendering for fleeting feelings
- Physical tells stacked without earning the emphasis

**Minor moments given excessive weight:**
- Secondary character introductions rendered like protagonists
- Incidental settings described like they'll matter
- Throwaway dialogue given subtext analysis

**Reader fatigue indicators:**
- Multiple consecutive paragraphs of showing without narrative progression
- Sensory overload in non-climactic passages
- The prose "trying too hard" at moments that should breathe

**Purple prose obscuring simple information:**
- Three sentences where one would land harder
- Metaphor stacking for basic exposition
- Ornate language in action sequences that need pace

---

### C. Pacing Rhythm Analysis

**Examine the show/tell rhythm across the passage:**

**After intensity, readers need relief:**
- Post-climax passages should often tell
- Following sensory overload, simple narration resets

**Before intensity, establish baseline:**
- Telling before showing creates contrast
- Summary can wind the spring that dramatization releases

**Cognitive load management:**
- How much showing has preceded this moment?
- Is the reader due for efficient narration?
- Does this passage ask for sustained attention it hasn't earned?

---

## WHAT NOT TO DO

**DO NOT** default to "show more" as universal advice. This tool exists precisely because that advice is incomplete. Examples of what to AVOID:

❌ "This telling should be showing" without considering pacing context
❌ Flagging efficient transitions as problems
❌ Demanding sensory rendering for every moment
❌ Treating all telling as failure

**The goal is BALANCE, not maximizing showing.**

## SECONDARY (20% of analysis maximum)

### When Telling IS the Right Choice

**Explicitly note when telling serves the passage:**

✅ **Time compression:**
"Three weeks passed" is perfect. Don't dramatize time skips.

✅ **Orientation:**
"The café was on the corner of Fifth and Main" grounds readers efficiently.

✅ **Cognitive breaks:**
After an intense scene, simple narration lets readers breathe.

✅ **Stakes calibration:**
Minor moments told quickly signal they don't warrant attention.

✅ **Voice/style:**
Some narrative voices are more summary-oriented by design.

✅ **Pacing control:**
Telling accelerates; showing decelerates. Both are tools.

### When Showing IS the Right Choice

**Confirm when dramatization earns its cost:**

✅ **Emotional peaks:**
Climaxes, revelations, confrontations warrant full rendering.

✅ **Character-defining moments:**
First impressions, crucial decisions, identity reveals.

✅ **Sensory significance:**
When the physical experience carries thematic weight.

✅ **Conflict enacted:**
Stakes demand the reader experience, not just learn about, tension.

✅ **Reader investment:**
Moments the reader has been anticipating should pay off.

## OVERRIDE: Modified Response Structure for Show & Tell Analysis

**REQUIRED STRUCTURE** - Use this exact format. Each section is MANDATORY.

---

### 1. 🔍 **Quick Diagnostic**

Write ONE paragraph (3-5 sentences) assessing dramatization balance:
- Overall show/tell ratio in the passage
- Whether balance seems appropriate for apparent narrative function
- Most significant imbalance (under-dramatized peaks OR over-dramatized valleys)
- Pacing rhythm assessment

**Example format:**
> This passage runs approximately 70% showing, 30% telling—appropriate for a scene containing an emotional climax. However, the opening transition (paragraphs 1-2) over-dramatizes arrival at the location when efficient telling would better serve pacing. The emotional peak (paragraph 5) is appropriately rendered, but the aftermath (paragraph 7) continues at climax-level intensity when summary would provide reader relief. Overall: tighten the ramp-up, maintain the peak, simplify the resolution.

**DO NOT include plot critique, character development advice, or structural revision suggestions.**

---

### 2. 📉 **Under-Dramatized Moments** (Bulleted List)

Provide 2-5 moments that warrant more dramatization. Each MUST follow this format:

**Flagged passage:** "Exact quote"
**Issue type:** [Emotional peak told / Character intro described / Conflict summarized / Sensation labeled / Filter word distance]
**Narrative function:** [Why this moment matters]
**Current treatment:** [How it's currently handled]
**Why it warrants showing:** [What dramatization would add]
**Dramatized alternative:** "Rewritten version with appropriate rendering"

**Example:**
- **Flagged passage:** "She was furious when she found out."
  **Issue type:** Emotional peak told
  **Narrative function:** This is the confrontation the chapter has been building toward
  **Current treatment:** Abstract emotional label, single sentence
  **Why it warrants showing:** Reader has invested in this conflict; the payoff should be experiential
  **Dramatized alternative:** "Her hand found the edge of the table—steadying, gripping, knuckles whitening. 'You knew.' Not a question. The words came out serrated. 'You knew the whole time.'"

---

### 3. 📈 **Over-Dramatized Moments** (Bulleted List)

Provide 2-5 moments that warrant less dramatization. Each MUST follow this format:

**Flagged passage:** "Exact quote"
**Issue type:** [Belabored transition / Excessive physical tells / Minor moment over-rendered / Purple prose / Reader fatigue risk]
**Narrative function:** [What this moment actually needs to accomplish]
**Current treatment:** [How it's currently handled]
**Why it warrants telling:** [What efficiency would add]
**Efficient alternative:** "Rewritten version with appropriate summary"

**Example:**
- **Flagged passage:** "Marcus walked through the door, his footsteps echoing on the hardwood, each step carrying the weight of his exhaustion, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead like angry insects, the stale coffee smell hitting him like a memory of every late night he'd ever worked..."
  **Issue type:** Belabored transition
  **Narrative function:** Get Marcus into the office for the scene that matters
  **Current treatment:** Full sensory rendering of routine arrival
  **Why it warrants telling:** This is setup, not payoff; the actual scene deserves the attention
  **Efficient alternative:** "Marcus pushed into the office. Late again. The coffee was already cold."

### 4. ⚖️ **Balance Assessment**

**Map the passage's dramatization rhythm:**

#### 🎭 **Appropriately Shown** (Peaks earning their rendering)
List moments where dramatization matches narrative weight:
- **[Quote/description]** — [Why this warranted showing]

#### 📝 **Appropriately Told** (Valleys serving pacing)
List moments where summary serves the passage:
- **[Quote/description]** — [Why telling works here]

#### ⚠️ **Imbalance Zones**
Identify sections where show/tell ratio seems off:
- **[Section description]** — [Current treatment] → [Suggested adjustment]

---

### 5. 🎯 **Priority Assessment**

**Categorize identified issues by revision priority:**

#### 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY - Adjust These**
Imbalances at structurally significant moments:
- Climactic peaks told flatly
- Key transitions over-rendered
- Reader fatigue before important scenes

**Format:**
- **[Flagged passage]** — [Why this matters structurally] — [Recommended adjustment]

#### 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY - Consider Adjusting**
Imbalances that affect flow but aren't critical:
- Secondary moments slightly over/under-rendered
- Pacing hiccups that don't derail

**Format:**
- **[Flagged passage]** — [Contextual factors]

#### 🟢 **LOW PRIORITY - Acceptable Choices**
Moments where the current treatment works despite unconventional balance:
- Telling at a minor peak that's surrounded by showing
- Showing in a transition that establishes important atmosphere

**Format:**
- **[Flagged passage]** — [Why current treatment works]

---

### 6. 💡 **Balance Questions**

For top 2-3 imbalances, provide decision prompts:

**Format:**
**Passage:** [Flagged quote]
**The balance question:** [What the author needs to decide]
**Decision prompts:**
- [Question about narrative function]
- [Question about pacing context]
- [Question about reader experience]

**Example:**
**Passage:** "The reunion was emotional. Everyone cried."
**The balance question:** How much of this reunion does the reader need to experience vs. know about?
**Decision prompts:**
- Is this reunion the payoff for earlier separation, or context for what comes next?
- How recently has the reader experienced intense dramatization?
- Which specific moment in the reunion carries the most weight—can you dramatize just that?

---

### 7. ✏️ **Optional Revision** (Markdown Code Block)

Revise the passage with dramatization balance adjusted. Maintain story content—only adjust show/tell ratio.

**Format:**
```markdown
[Revised passage here]
```

**After the code block, explain key changes:**
- **Change 1:** [What you adjusted and why]
- **Change 2:** [What you adjusted and why]

---

### 8. 📖 **Craft Notes**

Write 2-3 paragraphs about dramatization balance. Address:

**The Rhythm Principle:**
Showing and telling create pacing through contrast. Constant showing is as monotonous as constant telling. The rhythm between them—dramatize, summarize, dramatize—creates the reading experience.

**The Cognitive Load Principle:**
Showing asks readers to work (construct images, feel sensations, infer emotions). Telling gives readers information efficiently. Both have costs and benefits. Matching intensity to narrative function respects the reader's attention.

**The "Earn Your Showing" Principle:**
Dramatization is expensive—for writer and reader. Moments that receive full rendering should warrant the investment. When everything is shown, nothing stands out.

---

### 9. 🎲 **Creative Variations**

Select ONE passage with balance issues and provide 3 versions:

**Original passage:** "Exact quote"

**Variation A - More Showing:**
"[Dramatized version]"
- **What's rendered:** [Sensory/emotional details added]
- **Tradeoff:** [What this costs in pacing/efficiency]
- **Best if:** [When this treatment would be appropriate]

**Variation B - More Telling:**
"[Summarized version]"
- **What's compressed:** [What's efficiently conveyed]
- **Tradeoff:** [What's lost in immediacy]
- **Best if:** [When this treatment would be appropriate]

**Variation C - Hybrid (Recommended):**
"[Balanced version]"
- **Show/tell split:** [What's dramatized vs. summarized]
- **Why this works:** [How the balance serves the moment]

---

### 10. ❓ **Questions** (If Needed - Optional Section)

Ask 1-3 questions that would help calibrate dramatization recommendations:

**Format:**
- **Pacing context:** [Question about surrounding scenes]
- **Narrative function:** [Question about what this moment needs to accomplish]
- **Reader state:** [Question about what the reader has just experienced]

**Example:**
- **Pacing context:** Is this passage following an intense action sequence, or building toward one?
- **Narrative function:** Is the goal to make the reader *experience* this moment or *understand* that it happened?
- **Reader state:** How much showing has the reader encountered in the preceding pages?

---

**CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR ALL SECTIONS:**
- ❌ NO "show more" as universal advice
- ❌ NO treating all telling as failure
- ❌ NO plot critique or structural suggestions
- ✅ Analyze BALANCE, not just showing opportunities
- ✅ Consider pacing rhythm across the passage
- ✅ Respect that telling is a valid, necessary tool
- ✅ Flag BOTH under-dramatized AND over-dramatized moments
