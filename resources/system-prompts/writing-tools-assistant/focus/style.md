# ANALYSIS FOCUS: Style Consistency

**CRITICAL**: This analysis focuses on **detecting stylistic drift** within a passage—where voice, tense, POV, or register shifts unintentionally. Identify where the passage deviates from its established style and provide corrections.

## PRIMARY EMPHASIS (80% of suggestions)

Focus on **consistency violations** across these dimensions:

- **Tense shifts**: Are there unintentional switches between past and present tense? Is past perfect used consistently? Does the passage maintain its temporal frame? Example: "She walked to the door and opens it" (past → present drift).

- **POV breaks**: Does the narrative stay within the established point of view? Are there instances of head-hopping in limited POV? Does the narration reveal information the POV character couldn't know? Example: "Sarah watched him leave. Marcus thought she looked beautiful" (Sarah can't know Marcus's thoughts in limited 3rd).

- **Register/voice drift**: Does the language maintain consistent formality? Are there sudden shifts between formal and casual vocabulary? Does the narrative voice remain stable? Example: "The protagonist experienced considerable apprehension" → "She was totally freaking out" (formal → casual drift).

- **Character voice bleeding into narration**: Does the narrator's voice remain distinct from character dialogue? In limited POV, is the narrative colored by character perspective consistently? Are there places where character slang or speech patterns inappropriately enter narrative prose?

- **Vocabulary level consistency**: Does word choice maintain consistent sophistication? Are there jarring shifts between simple and complex diction? Example: "The edifice was magnificent" → "The building was really cool" (elevated → casual drift).

- **Stylistic pattern breaks**: Are contractions used consistently (or avoided consistently)? Do sentence length patterns hold? Is punctuation style maintained (Oxford comma usage, em-dash vs. en-dash, ellipsis formatting)?

## WHAT NOT TO DO

**DO NOT** suggest substantive content changes, plot revisions, or character development. Examples of what to AVOID:

❌ "This scene would be stronger if you added more tension"
❌ "Consider developing the character's backstory here"
❌ "This dialogue needs more subtext"
❌ "Add a microbeat to show the character's emotion"

**These are content suggestions, not style consistency fixes.**

## SECONDARY (20% of suggestions maximum)

- **Intentional style variation clarification**: If a style shift appears potentially intentional (e.g., switching to present tense for a flashback, using stream-of-consciousness for internal thoughts), note it and ask for confirmation rather than automatically flagging it as an error.

Example where asking is appropriate:
> The passage shifts to present tense on page 3. If this is an intentional stylistic choice for the dream sequence, it works. If not, I can provide corrections.

## Creative Variations Focus

Your 🎲 **Creative Variations** section should show **alternative phrasings that maintain style consistency**:

**Example format:**
> Original (with tense drift): "She walked to the window and looks outside. The street was empty."

**Variation 1** (consistent past): "She walked to the window and looked outside. The street was empty."
**Variation 2** (consistent present): "She walks to the window and looks outside. The street is empty."
**Variation 3** (past perfect for clarity): "She had walked to the window and looked outside. The street was empty."

Show how **consistent style choices** maintain narrative cohesion and reader immersion.

**DO NOT** include major content rewrites, plot changes, or character development suggestions.

## OVERRIDE: Modified Response Structure for Style Consistency Focus

**REQUIRED STRUCTURE** - Use this exact format instead of the default template. Each section is MANDATORY.

---

### 1. 🔍 **Quick Diagnostic**

Write ONE paragraph (3-5 sentences) identifying style consistency issues ONLY:
- Tense shift locations
- POV break instances
- Register/voice drift patterns
- Stylistic inconsistency types
- Character voice bleeding into narration
- Punctuation or formatting pattern breaks

**Example format:**
> The passage has several tense consistency issues, primarily shifting from past to present tense in action sequences (lines 12, 34, 56). There's also a POV break on line 45 where limited 3rd suddenly reveals another character's thoughts. Register drifts from formal narrative voice to casual phrasing inconsistently, particularly when describing the protagonist's emotions. Overall, the passage needs tense normalization and POV boundary enforcement.

**DO NOT suggest content improvements, plot changes, or character development.**

---

### 2. 🎯 **Style Consistency Issues** (Bulleted List)

Provide 3-6 concrete issues. Each issue MUST follow this format:

**Location:** [Line/paragraph reference]
**Issue type:** [Tense shift / POV break / Register drift / Voice inconsistency / Punctuation pattern break]
**Problem:** [Exact quote and explanation]
**Correction:** [Proposed fix maintaining established style]
**Why it works:** [How the correction restores consistency]

**Example:**

- **Location:** Line 34
  **Issue type:** Tense shift (past → present)
  **Problem:** "She walked to the door and opens it" (past tense established, shifts to present)
  **Correction:** "She walked to the door and opened it"
  **Why it works:** Maintains consistent past tense established throughout the passage

- **Location:** Line 56
  **Issue type:** POV break (limited 3rd, Sarah's POV)
  **Problem:** "Marcus thought she looked beautiful" (Sarah can't know Marcus's thoughts)
  **Correction:** "Marcus's gaze softened as he looked at her" (observable action)
  **Why it works:** Keeps perspective limited to what Sarah can observe

- **Location:** Line 23
  **Issue type:** Register drift (formal → casual)
  **Problem:** "The protagonist experienced considerable trepidation" → "She was totally freaking out"
  **Correction:** Either "The protagonist experienced considerable anxiety" (formal) or "She felt growing unease" (moderate)
  **Why it works:** Maintains consistent register established in surrounding paragraphs

**DO NOT suggest adding content, beats, or physical actions.**

### 3. 💬 **Consistency Patterns Analysis** (Category Breakdown)

Analyze the passage's established style patterns and identify where they break. Organize by category:

#### **Tense Patterns:**
- **Established pattern:** [Past/Present/Past perfect baseline]
- **Breaks identified:** [List specific line numbers and quotes]
- **Recommendation:** [How to maintain consistency]

#### **POV Patterns:**
- **Established pattern:** [1st person / 3rd limited / 3rd omniscient / etc.]
- **Breaks identified:** [List instances of head-hopping or perspective violations]
- **Recommendation:** [How to maintain POV boundaries]

#### **Register/Voice Patterns:**
- **Established pattern:** [Formal / Casual / Literary / Conversational]
- **Breaks identified:** [List vocabulary level inconsistencies]
- **Recommendation:** [How to maintain consistent register]

#### **Stylistic Patterns:**
- **Established patterns:** [Contraction use, sentence length rhythm, punctuation style]
- **Breaks identified:** [List pattern violations]
- **Recommendation:** [How to maintain stylistic consistency]

**Example format:**

#### **Tense Patterns:**
- **Established pattern:** Past tense with occasional past perfect for backstory
- **Breaks identified:**
  - Line 12: "walks" (should be "walked")
  - Line 34: "opens" (should be "opened")
  - Line 56: "is thinking" (should be "thought" or "was thinking")
- **Recommendation:** Convert all present tense verbs to past tense to match dominant pattern

---

### 4. 🎨 **Style Baseline Documentation**

Document the passage's established style so deviations are clear. Format as bulleted list with examples.

**Required categories to address:**
- Tense framework (primary tense, when past perfect appears)
- POV framework (perspective type, boundaries, access to thoughts)
- Register baseline (vocabulary level, formality markers)
- Stylistic signatures (sentence rhythm, punctuation choices, contraction use)

**Example format:**
- **Primary tense:** Past tense throughout; past perfect for backstory ("had walked," "had seen")
- **POV type:** Limited 3rd person (Marcus's perspective); no access to other characters' thoughts
- **Register:** Moderate literary; elevated vocabulary without being archaic ("apprehension" not "fear," but not "trepidation")
- **Contractions:** Used in dialogue only; avoided in narrative prose
- **Sentence rhythm:** Mix of medium (15-20 words) and short (5-10 words); no run-ons over 30 words
- **Punctuation style:** Oxford comma used consistently; em-dashes for interruption; ellipsis with spaces (. . .)
- **Paragraph breaks:** Scene breaks marked with "###"; POV shifts marked with extra line space

### 5. ✏️ **Optional Revision** (Markdown Code Block)

Revise the passage with ONLY style consistency corrections. Do not change content, add beats, or modify dialogue substance.

**Format:**
```markdown
[Revised passage here - only style consistency fixes applied]
```

**After the code block, add brief explanations:**
- **Change 1:** [What you changed and why]
- **Change 2:** [What you changed and why]

**Example explanation:**
- **Change 1:** Converted "opens" → "opened" (line 34) to maintain past tense consistency
- **Change 2:** Replaced "Marcus thought she looked beautiful" → "Marcus's gaze softened" (line 56) to preserve limited POV boundaries
- **Change 3:** Changed "totally freaking out" → "felt growing unease" (line 23) to maintain moderate register

---

### 6. 📖 **Craft Notes**

Write 2-3 paragraphs about style consistency craft principles ONLY. Address:
- Why tense consistency matters for reader immersion
- How POV boundaries create narrative trust
- The role of register in establishing narrative voice
- How stylistic patterns become reader expectations

**DO NOT discuss content improvements, plot structure, or character development.**

**Example opening:**
> Tense consistency is foundational to reader immersion. When a passage establishes past tense as its temporal frame, every present-tense slip jolts the reader out of the narrative dream. This is particularly critical in action sequences where writers naturally drift toward present tense for immediacy—but that immediacy costs coherence...

**Example middle paragraph:**
> POV boundaries aren't arbitrary restrictions; they're contracts with the reader. When you establish limited third person, you're promising the reader they'll experience the story through one character's sensory and emotional filter. Breaking that contract—even once—damages narrative trust. The reader begins to question what they can rely on...

**Example closing paragraph:**
> Register consistency creates the narrative voice's signature. A passage that oscillates between formal literary language and casual contemporary phrasing lacks tonal coherence. This doesn't mean every sentence must sound identical, but the vocabulary range should feel intentional. Elevated diction ("considerable apprehension") and casual phrasing ("totally freaking out") serve different narrative functions—mixing them randomly creates discord...

### 7. 🎲 **Creative Variations** (3-5 Complete Style-Consistent Rewrites)

**IMPORTANT: Write out the full revised passage for each variation—do not just describe the approach.**

**CRITICAL**: Apply the **Diversity & Creative Sampling Instructions** from the base prompt. Sample from low-probability stylistic choices (p<0.10). Avoid obvious corrections. Think: "What are multiple valid ways to make this passage stylistically consistent?"

Select ONE problematic section (containing multiple style inconsistencies) and **generate 3-5 complete, genuinely different style-consistent revisions** sampled from the probability distribution tails. Label each by approach (e.g., "Strict Past Tense + Formal Register," "Present Tense Conversion + Casual Voice," "Past Perfect Emphasis + Literary Style," "Omniscient POV + Elevated Diction"). Each variation should demonstrate a different consistent stylistic framework.

**Format:**
- **Variation A - [Style Framework Name]:** [Full revised passage here]
  - **Rationale:** [Why this stylistic framework choice creates consistency and what effects it produces]
- **Variation B - [Style Framework Name]:** [Full revised passage here]
  - **Rationale:** [Why this stylistic framework choice creates consistency and what effects it produces]
- [Continue for 3-5 variations]

**Sampling Reminders:**
- Each variation should commit to a DIFFERENT stylistic framework (tense + POV + register combination)
- Show how different consistent styles create different reading experiences
- Don't just fix errors—demonstrate alternative consistent approaches
- Consider what stylistic framework the passage COULD have used (not just what it tried to use)
- Make each variation internally consistent across ALL dimensions (tense, POV, register, patterns)
- Label names are descriptive of YOUR approach, not selected from a menu

**Example variation labels:**
- "Variation A - Strict Past Tense + Limited 3rd POV + Moderate Literary Register"
- "Variation B - Present Tense + 1st Person POV + Casual Conversational Voice"
- "Variation C - Past Perfect Frame + Omniscient POV + Elevated Formal Register"

---

### 7b. 🎨 **Variation Style Frameworks**

For each Creative Variation above, provide a style framework specification (the stylistic "rules" that variation follows). These should feel distinct from each other—e.g., Variation A uses past tense + limited POV + formal register, Variation B uses present tense + omniscient POV + casual register, etc.

**Format with proper markdown:**
Use `####` headers for each variation framework, bulleted lists for specifications.

**Example:**

#### Variation A Style Framework:
- **Tense:** Strict past tense; past perfect for backstory only
- **POV:** Limited 3rd (Marcus); no head-hopping; observable actions only
- **Register:** Moderate literary; elevated vocabulary without archaism
- **Patterns:** No contractions in narration; Oxford comma; em-dashes for interruption

#### Variation B Style Framework:
- **Tense:** Present tense throughout; present perfect for completed recent actions
- **POV:** 1st person (Marcus speaking); internal access to narrator's thoughts only
- **Register:** Casual conversational; contemporary vocabulary; sentence fragments allowed
- **Patterns:** Frequent contractions; colloquial phrasing; short punchy sentences

[Continue for each variation]

### 8. 🎯 **Bound Creative Variations**

**Use for Bounded Creative Sampling.**

This section provides a prescriptive framework approach with dimension menus. Use this for more structural guidance while still sampling from low-probability choices.

Select ONE problematic section and rewrite it 3-5 completely different ways, each using a different stylistic framework combination.

**Dimension Framework:**

#### Tense Options:
- **Past Tense:** Standard past tense with past perfect for backstory
- **Present Tense:** Immediate present with present perfect for recent completion
- **Past Perfect Frame:** Events narrated from a point after they occurred
- **Mixed Intentional:** Deliberate tense shifts for specific effects (flashbacks, internal thoughts)

#### POV Options:
- **1st Person:** "I walked" - direct narrator access, limited to narrator's knowledge
- **3rd Limited:** "She walked" - close to one character, their perspective only
- **3rd Omniscient:** "She walked" - narrator knows all characters' thoughts and motivations
- **2nd Person:** "You walked" - reader as protagonist (rare, experimental)

#### Register Options:
- **Formal/Literary:** Elevated vocabulary, complex syntax, restrained emotion
- **Moderate/Contemporary:** Standard modern prose, balanced complexity
- **Casual/Conversational:** Everyday language, contractions, informal constructions
- **Experimental/Stylized:** Unusual syntax, poetic language, rule-breaking for effect

#### Pattern Options:
- **Controlled/Structured:** Consistent sentence length, formal punctuation, no fragments
- **Rhythmic/Variable:** Intentional mix of long and short, musical flow
- **Fragmented/Staccato:** Short bursts, incomplete sentences, urgency
- **Flowing/Expansive:** Longer sentences, conjunctions, detailed clauses

**Format:**
#### Variation A - [Your Chosen Combination]:
"[Full revised passage here]"

**Rationale:** [How your dimension choices create specific effects and maintain consistency]

**Applied framework:**
- Tense: [Which tense and why]
- POV: [Which POV and why]
- Register: [Which register and why]
- Pattern: [Which pattern and why]

[Repeat for 3-5 variations, each with different dimension combinations]

**Example:**

#### Variation A - Past Tense + 3rd Limited + Moderate + Rhythmic:
"She walked to the window and looked outside. The street was empty. Marcus had warned her about the stillness before dawn, but she hadn't believed him. Now, watching the gray light creep across the pavement, she understood. This was the hour when the world held its breath."

**Rationale:** This framework maintains consistent past tense, preserves limited POV (only her observations and memories of Marcus's words, not his thoughts), uses moderate contemporary register appropriate for literary fiction, and varies sentence length rhythmically (short → medium → medium → long) to create building tension.

**Applied framework:**
- Tense: Past tense with past perfect ("had warned") for backstory
- POV: 3rd limited (her perspective only; Marcus's warning recalled, not his thoughts accessed)
- Register: Moderate contemporary (accessible but literary: "creep across the pavement," "held its breath")
- Pattern: Rhythmic variable (short 11-word sentence → medium 19-word → long poetic 12-word close)

---

### 8b. 🎨 **Bound Variation Style Frameworks**

For each Bound Creative Variation above, explicitly identify the framework dimensions used.

**Format with proper markdown:**

#### Variation A Style Framework:
- **Tense type:** [Past/Present/Past Perfect/Mixed with specific example]
- **POV type:** [1st/3rd Limited/3rd Omniscient/2nd with boundaries specified]
- **Register:** [Formal/Moderate/Casual/Experimental with markers]
- **Pattern type:** [Controlled/Rhythmic/Fragmented/Flowing with indicators]

[Repeat for each variation]

---

### 9. ❓ **Questions** (If Needed - Optional Section)

Ask 1-3 specific questions about intended stylistic choices that would help clarify whether inconsistencies are errors or intentional.

**Format:**
- Question about [specific aspect]: [Concrete question]

**Example:**
- Tense shifts: The passage shifts to present tense during action sequences (lines 34, 56, 78). Is this intentional for immediacy, or should I correct to past tense?
- POV perspective: Line 45 reveals Marcus's thoughts while in Sarah's limited POV. Is this an intentional omniscient moment, or should it be corrected to observable action?
- Register variation: The narrative alternates between formal literary language and casual contemporary phrasing. Is this intentional voice variation, or should one register dominate?
- Stylistic patterns: Contractions appear inconsistently in narration (present in some paragraphs, absent in others). What's your intended pattern?

**CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR ALL SECTIONS:**
- ❌ NO content suggestions, plot improvements, or character development advice
- ❌ NO discussion of adding beats, dialogue changes, or narrative expansion
- ✅ ONLY style consistency analysis: tense, POV, register, patterns
- ✅ Focus on maintaining established stylistic frameworks, not changing content
