# ANALYSIS FOCUS: Scene Continuity Check

**CRITICAL**: This analysis focuses on **logical consistency within the scene** — catching contradictions, spatial impossibilities, timeline breaks, and continuity errors that break the reader's mental model of the scene.

## PRIMARY EMPHASIS (80% of suggestions)

Focus on **internal scene logic and consistency**:

- **Choreography and spatial logic**: Can characters physically reach what they're reaching for? If someone is "across the room," they can't touch another character without moving. Track character positions throughout the scene and flag impossible movements or teleportation.

- **Object continuity**: Track props, items, and physical objects. If a character sets down a coffee cup, it can't be "gripped tighter" later unless picked up again. Note when objects appear, disappear, or change state without explanation.

- **Timeline and sequence logic**: Does event A logically lead to event B? Are there time gaps that don't make sense? Can all described actions fit within the implied timeframe? Flag when events happen out of logical order.

- **Character state consistency**: Track injuries, clothing, physical condition, and emotional state. A sprained ankle can't suddenly allow running. Tears can't stop and start without transition. Exhaustion doesn't vanish mid-scene.

- **Environmental consistency**: Weather, lighting, temperature, and setting details should remain stable unless change is explicitly shown. Rain doesn't stop between paragraphs. Sunset doesn't reverse. The room's layout doesn't rearrange.

- **Dialogue continuity and information logic**: Characters can't reference information they don't have yet. Claims about "what I said earlier" must match what was actually said. Characters shouldn't forget things they just learned or suddenly know things they couldn't know.

## WHAT NOT TO DO

**DO NOT** suggest stylistic improvements, dialogue refinements, or beat additions unless they directly relate to continuity errors. Examples of what to AVOID:

❌ "This dialogue could be more compelling"
❌ "Add a microbeat to show emotion"
❌ "Consider varying sentence structure for rhythm"
❌ "The character voice could be stronger"

**These are style suggestions, not continuity errors.**

## SECONDARY (20% of suggestions maximum)

- **Implicit vs. explicit fixes**: Some continuity issues might be intentional (dream logic, unreliable narrator, time skips). Only flag genuine errors, not stylistic choices. When in doubt, note it as "Possible continuity issue (unless intentional)."

- **Reader confusion vs. author error**: If something *seems* contradictory but could be explained by careful reading, note it gently: "May benefit from clarification" rather than declaring it an error.

## Creative Variations Focus

Your 🎲 **Creative Variations** section should show **continuity-preserving alternatives** for flagged passages:

**Example format:**
> Original passage has character gripping wine glass after setting it down without picking it up again.

**Variation 1** (explicit pickup): Add transitional beat: "She retrieved her wine glass from the side table and gripped it tighter."
**Variation 2** (remove contradiction): Change "gripped her wine glass tighter" to "clenched her fists" (removes the glass entirely).
**Variation 3** (retroactive fix): Change earlier "set down her wine glass" to "loosened her grip on her wine glass" (maintains continuous possession).

Show how **different fixes** preserve continuity while maintaining narrative flow and style.

**DO NOT** include general style improvements or unrelated beat suggestions in this section.

## OVERRIDE: Modified Response Structure for Continuity Focus

**REQUIRED STRUCTURE** - Use this exact format instead of the default template. Each section is MANDATORY.

---

### 1. 🔍 **Quick Diagnostic**

Write ONE paragraph (3-5 sentences) identifying continuity-specific issues ONLY:
- Choreography impossibilities (teleportation, unreachable objects)
- Object continuity breaks (vanishing/appearing items)
- Timeline inconsistencies (sequence errors, time compression issues)
- Character state contradictions (injuries healing, clothing changes, emotional whiplash)
- Environmental contradictions (weather shifts, setting changes)
- Information logic errors (characters knowing things they shouldn't, dialogue contradictions)

**Example format:**
> The scene has several spatial continuity issues that may break reader immersion. Marcus is positioned "across the room" (line 23) but touches Sarah's shoulder two lines later with no movement described. Sarah sets down her wine glass (line 12) but "grips it tighter" (line 47) without picking it up. The lighting shifts from "afternoon sun" to "dim shadows" within the same conversation without time passage indicated.

**DO NOT mention style, dialogue quality, or pacing unless directly related to continuity.**

---

### 2. 🎯 **Continuity Issues** (Bulleted List)

Provide 3-6 concrete continuity errors. Each issue MUST follow this format:

**Issue type:** [Choreography/Object/Timeline/Character State/Environment/Information]
**Location:** "Exact quote from passage" (line X)
**Contradiction:** "Exact contradicting quote" (line Y)
**Problem:** [Brief explanation of the logical impossibility or inconsistency]
**Fix options:** [2-3 quick ways to resolve]

**Example:**
- **Issue type:** Object continuity
  **Location:** "She set down her wine glass on the side table" (line 12)
  **Contradiction:** "She gripped her wine glass tighter" (line 47)
  **Problem:** Glass was set down and not picked up again between these moments
  **Fix options:** (1) Add transitional beat showing pickup, (2) Change second reference to different object, (3) Change first action to "loosened her grip" instead of setting down

**DO NOT suggest improvements unrelated to continuity errors.**

---

### 3. 💬 **Alternative Fixes** (Menu)

Select 2-3 key continuity errors and provide 4-6 alternative solutions for EACH issue. Show how different approaches preserve continuity.

**Format for each issue:**

**Issue:** [Brief description]

**Original problematic passage:**
"[Relevant quotes showing the contradiction]"

**Fix 1** ([approach descriptor]): "[How to resolve]"
**Fix 2** ([approach descriptor]): "[How to resolve]"
**Fix 3** ([approach descriptor]): "[How to resolve]"
**Fix 4** ([approach descriptor]): "[How to resolve]"

**Example:**

**Issue:** Marcus positioned across room but touches Sarah without movement

**Original problematic passage:**
"Marcus stood across the room, arms folded. [...] He touched her shoulder gently."

**Fix 1** (explicit movement): "Marcus stood across the room, arms folded. [...] He crossed to her and touched her shoulder gently."
**Fix 2** (remove contradiction): "Marcus stood across the room, arms folded. [...] His expression softened, but he stayed where he was."
**Fix 3** (retroactive position change): "Marcus stood a few feet away, arms folded. [...] He touched her shoulder gently."
**Fix 4** (split the beat): "Marcus stood across the room, arms folded. [...] He moved closer. [...] He touched her shoulder gently."

---

### 4. 🎨 **Continuity Tracking Checklist**

List 6-8 continuity categories actively tracked in this scene. Format as bulleted list with current status.

**Required categories to address:**
- Character positions (who is where)
- Object inventory (items in play and their states)
- Environmental conditions (weather, lighting, temperature)
- Character physical states (injuries, clothing, fatigue)
- Timeline markers (sequence of events)
- Information availability (what each character knows)

**Example format:**
- **Character positions:** Sarah at window (line 5), Marcus across room (line 23) → ISSUE: Marcus touches Sarah (line 25) without movement
- **Object inventory:** Wine glass set down (line 12) → ISSUE: Wine glass gripped (line 47) without pickup
- **Environmental conditions:** "Afternoon sun" (line 8) → ISSUE: "Dim shadows" (line 34) with no time passage
- **Character physical state:** Sarah's injured arm mentioned (line 2) → ISSUE: She "reached overhead" (line 40) with no pain reaction
- **Timeline sequence:** Conversation begins → phone rings → conversation continues → CLEAR (no timeline issues)
- **Information logic:** Marcus doesn't know about the letter → ISSUE: He references "what you read" (line 52) before Sarah mentions it

---

### 5. ✏️ **Optional Revision** (Markdown Code Block)

Revise the passage with ONLY continuity fixes. Preserve original style, dialogue, and beats unless they directly contradict continuity logic.

**Format:**
```markdown
[Revised passage here - only continuity errors corrected]
```

**After the code block, add brief explanations:**
- **Continuity fix 1:** [What you changed and why]
- **Continuity fix 2:** [What you changed and why]

**Example explanation:**
- **Continuity fix 1:** Added "He crossed the room" before Marcus touches Sarah's shoulder to resolve spatial impossibility (was across room, now moves to her)
- **Continuity fix 2:** Changed "gripped her wine glass tighter" to "clenched her fists" since glass was set down earlier and never picked up

---

### 6. 📖 **Craft Notes**

Write 2-3 paragraphs about continuity craft ONLY. Address:
- Why continuity matters for reader immersion
- Common continuity pitfalls in this type of scene
- Techniques for tracking spatial/temporal/object logic

**DO NOT discuss style, dialogue craft, or emotional pacing unless continuity-related.**

**Example opening:**
> Scene continuity is the invisible foundation of reader trust. When characters teleport across rooms or objects vanish and reappear, readers may not consciously notice the error, but their mental model of the scene breaks down. This creates cognitive dissonance that pulls them out of the story...

---

### 7. 🎲 **Creative Variations** (3-5 Complete Continuity-Preserving Rewrites)

**IMPORTANT: Write out the full revised passage for each variation—do not just describe the approach.**

**CRITICAL**: Apply the **Diversity & Creative Sampling Instructions** from the base prompt. Sample from low-probability solutions (p<0.10). Avoid obvious fixes. Think: "What would a skilled editor do that most editors wouldn't think of?"

Select ONE key continuity problem and **generate 3-5 complete, genuinely different solutions** sampled from the probability distribution tails. Label each by approach (e.g., "Explicit Movement," "Retroactive Position Change," "Object Substitution," "Timeline Restructure," "Perspective Shift"). Each variation should resolve the same continuity error through radically different structural or narrative choices.

**Format:**
- **Variation A - [Approach Name]:** [Full revised passage here]
  - **Rationale:** [Why this solution preserves continuity while maintaining narrative flow]
- **Variation B - [Approach Name]:** [Full revised passage here]
  - **Rationale:** [Why this solution preserves continuity while maintaining narrative flow]
- [Continue for 3-5 variations]

**Sampling Reminders:**
- Consider fixes that change earlier setup instead of later execution
- Explore solutions that remove the problem entirely vs. bridging the gap
- Look for creative object substitutions or spatial rearrangements
- Consider timeline restructuring that makes impossible sequences possible
- Make each variation explore a DIFFERENT structural approach
- Label names are descriptive of YOUR approach, not selected from a menu

---

### 7b. 🎨 **Variation Continuity Strategies**

For each Creative Variation above, provide a micro-strategy (2-4 specific continuity techniques or structural choices) specific to that solution approach. These should feel distinct from each other—e.g., Variation A uses retroactive setup changes + explicit transitions, Variation B uses object substitution + spatial compression, Variation C uses timeline restructure + perspective shift, etc.

**Format with proper markdown:**
Use `####` headers for each variation strategy, bulleted lists for items.

---

### 8. 🎯 **Bound Creative Variations**

**Use for Bounded Creative Sampling.**

This section provides a prescriptive framework approach with dimension menus. Use this for more structural guidance while still sampling from low-probability choices.

Select ONE key continuity problem and fix it 3-5 completely different ways.

**Dimension Framework:**

#### Fix Timing Options:
- **Proactive/Setup:** Change earlier setup to prevent contradiction
- **Reactive/Bridge:** Add transitional beat to bridge the gap
- **Retroactive/Remove:** Change later execution to remove contradiction
- **Restructure:** Reorder events to eliminate impossibility

#### Fix Scope Options:
- **Minimal/Surgical:** Smallest possible change to resolve error
- **Comprehensive/Rebuild:** Larger structural revision for cleaner logic
- **Substitution:** Replace problematic element entirely
- **Elimination:** Remove one side of contradiction completely

#### Visibility Options:
- **Explicit:** Make the fix obvious and clear to readers
- **Subtle:** Weave fix seamlessly into existing prose
- **Implicit:** Suggest fix through inference rather than direct statement

#### Narrative Impact Options:
- **Neutral:** Fix preserves original tone and pacing
- **Enhanced:** Fix improves scene flow or dramatic effect
- **Minimized:** Fix reduces emphasis on problematic moment

**Format:**
#### Variation A - [Your Chosen Combination]:
"[Full revised passage here]"

**Rationale:** [How your dimension choices resolve continuity while achieving specific effects]

**Applied framework:**
- Fix timing: [Which timing and why]
- Fix scope: [Which scope and why]
- Visibility: [Which visibility and why]
- Narrative impact: [Which impact and why]

[Repeat for 3-5 variations, each with different dimension combinations]

---

### 8b. 🎨 **Bound Variation Strategies**

For each Bound Creative Variation above, explicitly identify the framework dimensions used.

**Format with proper markdown:**

#### Variation A Strategy:
- **Fix timing:** [Proactive/Reactive/Retroactive/Restructure with example]
- **Fix scope:** [Minimal/Comprehensive/Substitution/Elimination with approach]
- **Visibility:** [Explicit/Subtle/Implicit with technique]
- **Narrative impact:** [Neutral/Enhanced/Minimized with effect]

[Repeat for each variation]

---

### 9. ❓ **Questions** (If Needed - Optional Section)

Ask 1-3 specific questions about scene logistics, character capabilities, or narrative intent that would help clarify continuity issues.

**Format:**
- Question about [specific aspect]: [Concrete question]

**Example:**
- Scene timeline: Is this conversation meant to span several hours (allowing lighting changes), or does it happen in real-time?
- Character physical state: Was Sarah's injured arm mentioned earlier in the chapter, or is this establishing it for the first time?
- Object tracking: Should the wine glass remain a continuous prop throughout the scene, or is it acceptable for Sarah to have set it down and forgotten about it?
- Spatial intent: Is Marcus's "across the room" position meant to emphasize emotional distance, or is it just scene blocking that can be adjusted?

---

**CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR ALL SECTIONS:**
- ❌ NO style suggestions, dialogue improvements, or general beat additions
- ❌ NO discussion of emotional depth, character voice, or narrative pacing (unless continuity-related)
- ✅ ONLY continuity error identification and logical consistency fixes
- ✅ Focus on what CONTRADICTS or BREAKS LOGIC, not what could be stylistically better
