# ANALYSIS FOCUS: Engagement & Freshness Check (Context-Aware Edition)

__CRITICAL__: This analysis focuses on __reader engagement factors__ within __narrative sequence__—flat characters, pacing problems, compelling stakes, and overall "page-turner" quality. Are readers going to keep reading, and is this passage doing the job it needs to do in the story's flow?

---

## FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE: Sequential Context Assessment

__Before evaluating engagement, understand the passage's narrative position:__

### Pre-Analysis Questions (Answer These First)

1. __What preceded this passage?__

   - Previous scene's tension level (High / Medium / Low)
   - Previous scene's function (Stakes raised? Emotional climax? Action? Worldbuilding?)
   - How did the previous scene end? (Hook? Resolution? Transition?)

2. __What follows this passage?__

   - Next scene's anticipated intensity (High / Medium / Low)
   - Next scene's likely function (Escalation? Revelation? Action? Continued development?)

3. __What is this passage's structural job?__

   - Breathing room after intensity?
   - Grounding before escalation?
   - Positioning characters for next beat?
   - Worldbuilding that establishes what's about to be disrupted?
   - Transition between story modes?

### Valid "Low-Tension" Functions

These functions legitimately require lower tension and should NOT be flagged as engagement problems if executed well:

- __Post-Climax Breath__: After emotional/action peaks, readers need processing time
- __Pre-Escalation Ground__: Before major plot turns, establish baseline/normal
- __Rhythmic Variation__: Between high-intensity scenes, prevent reader fatigue
- __Transition Bridge__: Moving between story modes (everyday → supernatural, action → reflection)
- __Strategic Worldbuilding__: Establishing environment/rules before they become critical
- __Positioning__: Moving characters into place for the next important beat

### When Low Tension IS Problematic

Flag low tension as an engagement issue when:

- __Opening chapter or opening of act__ (no earned breathing room yet)
- __Extended low-stakes stretch__ (multiple consecutive scenes without escalation)
- __No clear narrative purpose__ (no setup, no character development, pure description)
- __Worldbuilding disconnected from plot__ (information that doesn't serve imminent needs)
- __Failed transitions__ (should be moving between modes but isn't working)

### If Sequential Context Is Not Provided

- State "Sequential context unavailable - analyzing passage in isolation"
- Focus on intrinsic engagement factors (character depth, stakes clarity, sensory grounding)
- Note which contextual assessments cannot be made reliably
- Skip narrative rhythm analysis if no adjacent scenes available

---

## PRIMARY EMPHASIS (80% of suggestions)

Focus on __engagement and freshness diagnostics__ within sequential context:

- __Character depth and agency__: Are characters feeling like real people or cardboard cutouts? Do they have distinct voices, contradictions, wants vs. needs? Are they DOING things or having things happen TO them?

- __Pacing dynamics__: Is the scene moving at the right speed __for its function__? Too much description slowing necessary action? Rushed emotional beats that need breathing room? Scenes that overstay their welcome relative to their job?

- __Stakes and tension__: What's at risk? Why should the reader care? Is there enough at stake (external AND internal) __for this passage's position in the sequence__? Does tension build appropriately or plateau inappropriately?

- __Reader curiosity hooks__: Are there questions planted that make readers want answers? Micro-tensions that pull forward? Promise of conflict or revelation that pays off what was set up?

- __Emotional engagement__: Can readers feel what characters feel? Are emotional beats earned or forced? Is there emotional variety or monotony?

- __Scene purpose clarity__: Does this scene DO something within the larger sequence—advance plot, reveal character, raise stakes, provide necessary breath? Or does it feel like filler even within its context?

## WHAT NOT TO DO

__DO NOT__ focus on line-level prose, grammar, or cliches. This is about story engagement, not sentence polish. Examples of what to AVOID:

- "This sentence should be reworded..."
- "Consider replacing this cliche..."
- "Grammar issue: comma splice..."
- "Word choice suggestion: instead of X, use Y..."

__These are prose-level issues, not engagement-level concerns.__

## SECONDARY (20% of suggestions maximum)

- __Genre expectations__: Is this delivering what readers of this genre came for? (Romance readers want romantic tension, thriller readers want danger)
- __Originality markers__: Where does this feel fresh vs. familiar? What's the unique angle?

## OVERRIDE: Modified Response Structure for Engagement Analysis

__REQUIRED STRUCTURE__ - Use this exact format instead of the default template. Each section is MANDATORY.

---

### 1. __Sequential Context Assessment__ (NEW - MANDATORY FIRST SECTION)

Answer these questions before any engagement evaluation:

__Previous Scene:__

- Tension level: [High / Medium / Low]
- Primary function: [What it did]
- Ending: [How it concluded]

__This Passage:__

- Apparent function: [What job it seems designed to do]
- Tension level: [High / Medium / Low]
- Key elements: [What it contains - action, dialogue, description, internal, etc.]

__Next Scene (if known):__

- Anticipated intensity: [High / Medium / Low]
- Expected function: [What's likely coming]

__Contextual Assessment:__ [2-3 sentences evaluating whether this passage's tension/pacing is APPROPRIATE for its position in the sequence. Is low tension justified? Is it successfully performing its function?]

---

### 2. __Quick Diagnostic__

Write ONE paragraph (3-5 sentences) assessing overall engagement level __in context__:

- Character investment: Do we care about these people?
- Pacing assessment: Too fast, too slow, or well-calibrated for its function?
- Stakes clarity: What's at risk and why it matters (appropriate for this beat)?
- Page-turner factor: Would you keep reading given what came before/after?
- Overall engagement grade considering context (Strong / Moderate / Needs Work)

__Example format:__

> This passage serves as breathing room after the high-tension confrontation in the previous scene, and successfully provides grounding before the supernatural intrusion that follows. The protagonist is sympathetic and the silverware moment creates genuine emotional resonance. However, even accounting for its transitional function, the social geography section overstays its welcome—the worldbuilding could accomplish its grounding purpose in half the space. The passage does its sequential job but could do it more efficiently. Overall: Moderate—functional but could be tightened.

---

  - Appropriate for passage function? [Yes/No]
- [Hook 2]: [Quote or describe] — __Pull strength:__ [Strong / Medium / Weak]
  - Appropriate for passage function? [Yes/No]

__Hook assessment:__

Ask 1-3 questions that would help assess contextual appropriateness:

__Format:__

- __About previous scene:__ [What happened before that this responds to?]
- __About next scene:__ [What's coming that this prepares for?]
- __About overall arc:__ [Where in the larger story does this sit?]

---

- __NO line-level prose suggestions__ (word choice, grammar, cliches)
- __NO style or voice commentary__ beyond distinctiveness
- __ONLY engagement, pacing, stakes, character depth, reader investment__
- __RESPECT valid transitional/grounding functions__ - don't demand inappropriate tension
- Focus on "Would readers keep reading?" AND "Is this doing its sequential job?"
