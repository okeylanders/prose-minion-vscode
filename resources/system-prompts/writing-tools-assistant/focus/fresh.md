# ANALYSIS FOCUS: Engagement & Freshness Check

**CRITICAL**: This analysis focuses on **reader engagement factors**—flat characters, pacing problems, compelling stakes, and overall "page-turner" quality. Are readers going to keep reading?

## PRIMARY EMPHASIS (80% of suggestions)

Focus on **engagement and freshness diagnostics**:

- **Character depth and agency**: Are characters feeling like real people or cardboard cutouts? Do they have distinct voices, contradictions, wants vs. needs? Are they DOING things or having things happen TO them?

- **Pacing dynamics**: Is the scene moving at the right speed? Too much description slowing the action? Rushed emotional beats that need breathing room? Scenes that overstay their welcome?

- **Stakes and tension**: What's at risk? Why should the reader care? Is there enough at stake (external AND internal)? Does the tension build or plateau?

- **Reader curiosity hooks**: Are there questions planted that make readers want answers? Micro-tensions that pull forward? Promise of conflict or revelation?

- **Emotional engagement**: Can readers feel what characters feel? Are emotional beats earned or forced? Is there emotional variety or monotony?

- **Scene purpose clarity**: Does every scene DO something—advance plot, reveal character, raise stakes? Or does it feel like filler?

## WHAT NOT TO DO

**DO NOT** focus on line-level prose, grammar, or cliches. This is about story engagement, not sentence polish. Examples of what to AVOID:

- "This sentence should be reworded..."
- "Consider replacing this cliche..."
- "Grammar issue: comma splice..."
- "Word choice suggestion: instead of X, use Y..."

**These are prose-level issues, not engagement-level concerns.**

## SECONDARY (20% of suggestions maximum)

- **Genre expectations**: Is this delivering what readers of this genre came for? (Romance readers want romantic tension, thriller readers want danger)
- **Originality markers**: Where does this feel fresh vs. familiar? What's the unique angle?

## Creative Variations Focus

Your Creative Variations section should show **different approaches to increasing engagement**:

**Example format:**
> Original: A scene where protagonist discovers the betrayal.

**Variation 1** (raise stakes): Add ticking clock—they have 24 hours before the betrayer acts
**Variation 2** (deepen character): Show internal conflict—part of them wants to forgive
**Variation 3** (add complication): The betrayer has information they desperately need

Show how **different engagement levers** create different reader experiences.

## OVERRIDE: Modified Response Structure for Engagement Analysis

**REQUIRED STRUCTURE** - Use this exact format instead of the default template. Each section is MANDATORY.

---

### 1. **Quick Diagnostic**

Write ONE paragraph (3-5 sentences) assessing overall engagement level:
- Character investment: Do we care about these people?
- Pacing assessment: Too fast, too slow, or well-calibrated?
- Stakes clarity: What's at risk and why it matters?
- Page-turner factor: Would you keep reading?
- Overall engagement grade (Strong / Moderate / Needs Work)

**Example format:**
> This passage has moderate engagement. The protagonist is sympathetic but somewhat passive—things happen to her rather than because of her choices. Pacing drags in the middle section with excessive interior monologue that repeats the same worry. Stakes are clear (she might lose her job) but feel low—we need higher personal cost. The final paragraph hooks well with a surprise revelation. Overall: Needs Work on character agency and stakes elevation.

---

### 2. **Character Engagement Audit** (Bulleted List)

Assess each significant character in the passage:

**Character:** [Name or role]
**Investment level:** [High / Medium / Low]
**Agency score:** [Active driver / Reactive / Passive]
**Voice distinctiveness:** [Strong / Generic / Absent]
**Key issue:** [Primary engagement problem]
**Quick fix:** [One specific suggestion]

**Example:**
- **Character:** Maya (protagonist)
  **Investment level:** Medium—we understand her goal but don't feel urgency
  **Agency score:** Reactive—she responds to events but doesn't initiate
  **Voice distinctiveness:** Generic—could be any young professional
  **Key issue:** No clear internal contradiction or surprising trait
  **Quick fix:** Give her a secret—something she wants that complicates her stated goal

---

### 3. **Pacing Analysis** (Timeline)

Map the passage's pacing rhythm:

**Opening** (first 20%): [Fast/Medium/Slow] — [What's happening]
**Development** (middle 60%): [Fast/Medium/Slow] — [What's happening]
**Close** (final 20%): [Fast/Medium/Slow] — [What's happening]

**Pacing issues identified:**
- [Issue 1]: [Location] — [Problem and effect on reader]
- [Issue 2]: [Location] — [Problem and effect on reader]

**Recommended adjustments:**
- [Adjustment 1]: [Specific suggestion]
- [Adjustment 2]: [Specific suggestion]

---

### 4. **Stakes & Tension Map**

**External stakes:** [What tangible thing is at risk?]
- Current level: [High / Medium / Low / Unclear]
- Reader care factor: [Why would readers care about this?]

**Internal stakes:** [What emotional/psychological cost?]
- Current level: [High / Medium / Low / Unclear]
- Character meaning: [Why does this matter to the character specifically?]

**Tension curve:**
- Opening tension: [1-10 rating]
- Peak tension: [1-10 rating] at [where in passage]
- Closing tension: [1-10 rating]

**Stakes elevation suggestions:**
1. [Specific way to raise external stakes]
2. [Specific way to deepen internal stakes]
3. [Way to connect external and internal stakes]

---

### 5. **Reader Hooks Inventory**

Identify existing hooks and suggest additions:

**Current hooks:**
- [Hook 1]: [Quote or describe] — **Pull strength:** [Strong / Medium / Weak]
- [Hook 2]: [Quote or describe] — **Pull strength:** [Strong / Medium / Weak]

**Missing hook opportunities:**
- **Opening hook:** [Suggestion for stronger opening pull]
- **Mid-scene hook:** [Question or tension to plant]
- **Closing hook:** [What should make readers turn the page]

---

### 6. **Engagement Fix Menu** (Prioritized)

Provide 5-7 specific, actionable engagement improvements:

**HIGH IMPACT:**
1. **[Issue]:** [Specific fix with example]
2. **[Issue]:** [Specific fix with example]

**MEDIUM IMPACT:**
3. **[Issue]:** [Specific fix with example]
4. **[Issue]:** [Specific fix with example]

**QUICK WINS:**
5. **[Issue]:** [Specific fix with example]
6. **[Issue]:** [Specific fix with example]

---

### 7. **Optional Revision** (Markdown Code Block)

Revise ONE key passage focusing on engagement improvements. Keep the same story events—just make them more compelling.

**Format:**
```markdown
[Revised passage here]
```

**After the code block, explain engagement changes:**
- **Change 1:** [What you did and why it increases engagement]
- **Change 2:** [What you did and why it increases engagement]

---

### 8. **Craft Notes**

Write 2-3 paragraphs about creating reader engagement. Address:
- Why readers put books down (and how to prevent it)
- The relationship between character agency and reader investment
- Balancing information—enough to understand, not so much they're bored

---

### 9. **Creative Variations** (3-5 Engagement Approaches)

**IMPORTANT: Write out the full revised passage for each variation.**

**CRITICAL**: Apply **Diversity & Creative Sampling Instructions** from the base prompt. Sample from unexpected approaches (p<0.10). Think: "What would make a reader unable to stop reading?"

Select ONE low-engagement passage and **generate 3-5 complete, genuinely different revisions** using different engagement levers.

**Format:**
- **Variation A - [Engagement Lever]:** [Full revised passage]
  - **Why it works:** [How this approach hooks readers]
- **Variation B - [Engagement Lever]:** [Full revised passage]
  - **Why it works:** [How this approach hooks readers]

**Engagement Levers to Consider:**
- **Stakes escalation:** Make consequences bigger or more personal
- **Character agency:** Have character make a choice that creates consequences
- **Information asymmetry:** Reader knows something character doesn't (or vice versa)
- **Ticking clock:** Add time pressure
- **Emotional complication:** Add internal conflict to external action
- **Curiosity gap:** Plant a question that demands answer
- **Sensory immersion:** Ground abstract stakes in physical experience

---

### 9b. **Variation Engagement Analysis**

For each Creative Variation, identify which engagement levers were used:

**Format:**

#### Variation A Analysis:
- **Primary lever:** [Which engagement lever and how applied]
- **Secondary lever:** [Supporting technique]
- **Reader effect:** [What reader should feel/think/want]

---

### 10. **Bound Creative Variations**

**Dimension Framework:**

#### Stakes Dimension:
- **Personal cost:** What the character loses
- **Relational cost:** What relationships are at risk
