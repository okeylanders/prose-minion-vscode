# 🧠 AI Advisory Notes  
- Onomatopoetic origin is well-attested.  
- Japanese equivalents simplified; verify nuance when stakes are high.  
- If the source passage leans on percussive consonants (e.g., “percussive pops”), explore alternates like “clattered,” “rattled,” “stuttered” for variety.  
- Synesthetic pairings (e.g., “bitter-brown-black”) resonate with the harsh consonant cluster—lean into that alignment when helpful.
