# Anti-Quartet Quick Reference

## The Problem: The Overused Quartet

In YA fiction (and this novel), emotion and intention often get channeled through the same four body parts:
- **Hands** (reaching, gripping, trembling, clenching)
- **Throat** (tightening, closing, words catching)
- **Gaze/Eyes** (meeting, holding, dropping, searching)
- **Shoulders** (tensing, dropping, hunching, squaring)

This guide provides quick, targeted alternatives organized by emotional context. Pull from these when you catch yourself defaulting to the quartet.

## Usage Notes

- **Awareness First:** Before revising, do a search for "hand/hands," "throat," "eyes/gaze," "shoulder/shoulders" to identify quartet density
- **Context Matters:** Not all uses of these words are bad—only when they become the *default* emotional channel
- **Character Consistency:** Some characters might naturally express through posture (Jasper), others through spatial dynamics (Raven), others through breath (Nate in artistic moments)
- **Sensory Integration:** When replacing quartet language, consider integrating other senses (sound, temperature, pressure, texture)

## Revision Workflow

1. **Hunt:** Search document for quartet words
2. **Flag:** Mark instances where the word is doing emotional heavy lifting
3. **Diagnose:** What emotion/intention is being conveyed?
4. **Substitute:** Find the appropriate alternative from this guide
5. **Test:** Read aloud to ensure the new language feels natural and fresh
