# Internal Sensations & Expression Descriptors

This guide provides alternatives for expressing emotion through internal physical sensations, breath patterns, facial expressions (non-gaze), and voice quality. These elements allow you to show emotional states without relying on the overused quartet (hands, throat, gaze, shoulders).

## Combined Examples (Multiple Systems)

### Terror
His breath fractured into gasps, chest constricting around lungs that couldn't seem to fill. Stomach dropped into free fall while spine locked rigid. Face drained of all color as jaw clenched involuntarily. When he tried to speak, voice came out pitched too high and barely audible.

### Joy
Air rushed into lungs in full, satisfying drafts. Chest expanded with warmth radiating outward. Smile pulled at facial muscles despite attempts at composure. Voice dropped to its natural register, words tumbling out quick and light.

### Grief Processing
Breath came heavy and controlled, each exhale carrying pieces of pain away. Chest hollowed around the ache, ribs closing protectively. Jaw trembled with suppressed emotion as lips compressed against feeling. Voice, when it finally emerged, was thin and threadbare.

### Artistic Flow State
Breathing deepened without conscious thought, finding rhythm with heartbeat. Chest opened, ribs expanding to make room. Facial muscles relaxed into soft focus. When he occasionally murmured, voice came low and distant, barely aware of producing sound.

## Cross-Reference

- **Anti-Quartet Quick Reference:** See `anti-quartet-quick-reference.md` for alternatives to overused body parts
- **Posture:** See `posture-descriptors.md` for expressing emotion through bearing and stance
- **Movement:** See `movement-descriptors.md` for expressing emotion through motion
- **Communication:** See `communication-descriptors.md` for nonverbal emotional exchanges

## Usage Notes

- **Sensory Specificity:** Internal sensations are particularly effective when specific rather than generic
- **Character Consistency:** Different characters might experience similar emotions through different physical systems
- **Pacing Consideration:** Internal sensation descriptions can slow pacing (use strategically)
- **Authenticity:** Ground unusual descriptions in recognizable physical experience
- **Combination:** Most powerful when combining 2-3 systems (breath + visceral + voice)

## Revision Application

When you find quartet language doing emotional work:

1. **Identify the emotion** being conveyed
2. **Select 1-3 systems** from this guide that match the emotion and character
3. **Replace with specific sensations** from appropriate categories
4. **Test for authenticity** - does this match real physical experience?
5. **Check pacing** - does the description serve or slow the moment?
