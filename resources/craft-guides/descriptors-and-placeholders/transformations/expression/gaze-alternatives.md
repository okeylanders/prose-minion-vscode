## Micro-expressions & Eye Detail

- Pupils: "His pupils pinched down" / "Her pupils widened with surprise."
- Blink rate: "He blinked once, twice, then stopped" / "Her blinking sped up."
- Lid/lash action: "She lowered her lashes" / "He looked at her over the rim of his lashes."
- Tear-holding: "There was a bright edge at the corner of his eye" / "A sheen gathered and refused to fall."
- Squint vs. open: "He narrowed his eyes as if reading fine print" / "Her eyes opened, taking him in fully."

## Timing, Beats, and Pacing

- Use looks as punctuation: a short glance = a comma; a long hold = a period.
- Break action with a look-beat: "He said it. She looked at him." (allows space for reaction).
- Reverse the line of dialogue to control emphasis: place the look before the line to show intent, after to show reaction.
- Vary length: rapid, scattered glances speed up a scene; held, steady looks slow it down and add gravity.

### Practical beats
- Pre-empt: "He glanced up, then spoke." (signals intent)
- Interrupt: "She looked away mid-sentence." (cuts the flow)
- Anchor: "He kept watching her the whole time." (maintains focus through a scene)

- Rewrite a scene where two characters avoid each other using only look-beats and actions (no explicit "gaze" or "look" verbs).
- Create a 6-line exchange where every line alternates between dialogue and a descriptive look-beat that moves the emotional arc forward.
- Take a neutral sentence ("They looked at each other.") and expand it into three tones: romantic, hostile, and ambivalent—using only eye/face descriptors.

## Emotional Calibration Matrix (use to match intensity)

- Mild interest: lingering glance, head tilt toward subject, slowed blink rate.
- Focused attention: narrowed lids, fixed pupils, stillness in head and shoulders.
- Challenge/Threat: unblinking stare, raised chin, tightened jaw, narrowed eyes.
