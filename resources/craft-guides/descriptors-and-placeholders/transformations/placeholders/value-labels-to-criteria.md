# Value Labels to Criteria - Micro-Guide

## The Problem

Value labels like "nice/good/bad," "awesome/amazing/cool," "beautiful/pretty/ugly," "weird/strange/odd" create weak prose by:
- Providing subjective judgments without evidence
- Failing to show readers WHY something deserves that label
- Missing opportunities to create specific, memorable images
- Using generic terms that could apply to anything
- Relying on reader assumptions instead of concrete details

## The Transformation

**Replace value labels with specific criteria that demonstrate WHY something earns that judgment.**

## Quick Examples

### Nice/Good/Bad
- ❌ "She was a good teacher" → ✅ "She remembered every student's name and learning style"
- ❌ "Bad weather" → ✅ "Rain hammered the windows, wind rattled the doors"
- ❌ "Nice car" → ✅ "The BMW purred like contentment itself"
- ❌ "Good food" → ✅ "Flavors that made conversation unnecessary"

### Awesome/Amazing/Cool  
- ❌ "That's so cool" → ✅ "That's the kind of move that wins championships"
- ❌ "Amazing performance" → ✅ "Every note hung perfect in the silence"
- ❌ "Awesome idea" → ✅ "The solution no one saw coming"
- ❌ "Really cool art" → ✅ "Colors that seemed to pulse with their own light"

### Beautiful/Pretty/Ugly/Scary
- ❌ "Beautiful sunset" → ✅ "Sky painted itself in shades of amber and rose"
- ❌ "Pretty dress" → ✅ "Fabric that moved like water"
- ❌ "Ugly building" → ✅ "Concrete blocks that crushed the spirit"
- ❌ "Scary movie" → ✅ "Images that would haunt sleep for weeks"

### Weird/Strange/Odd
- ❌ "That's weird" → ✅ "That defies every pattern I know"
- ❌ "Strange behavior" → ✅ "He counted steps between every streetlight"
- ❌ "Odd feeling" → ✅ "Like walking into a room after an argument"

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Identify the Label**: Find all generic value judgments
2. **Question the Standard**: What makes this good/bad/weird to this character?
3. **Concrete Evidence**: What specific details support this judgment?
4. **Sensory Proof**: What can readers see/hear/feel that proves the point?
5. **Character Filter**: How would this POV character measure this quality?

## Advanced Techniques

### Show the Impact
- ❌ "Scary sound" → ✅ "A sound that froze him mid-step"
- ❌ "Beautiful music" → ✅ "Notes that brought tears without warning"

### Use Comparison
- ❌ "Really tall" → ✅ "Had to duck through doorways"
- ❌ "Very smart" → ✅ "Solved problems others hadn't recognized yet"

### Character Reactions
- ❌ "Funny joke" → ✅ "Half the class was still giggling five minutes later"
- ❌ "Boring class" → ✅ "Three people were openly checking their phones"

### Environmental Response
- ❌ "Loud music" → ✅ "Music that vibrated through the floor"
- ❌ "Bright light" → ✅ "Light that made squinting necessary"

## Context-Specific Criteria

### Academic Contexts
- ❌ "Good student" → ✅ "The kind who asked questions that changed the discussion"
- ❌ "Hard class" → ✅ "Three students had already dropped by midterm"

### Artistic Contexts
- ❌ "Pretty colors" → ✅ "Colors that seemed to glow from within"
- ❌ "Good technique" → ✅ "Brushstrokes confident enough to trust"

### Athletic Contexts
- ❌ "Great player" → ✅ "The kind who made impossible shots look routine"
- ❌ "Tough opponent" → ✅ "Haven't lost a game in two seasons"

### Social Contexts
- ❌ "Popular kid" → ✅ "Everyone knew their name, wanted their attention"
- ❌ "Nice friend" → ✅ "Shows up without being asked"

## Emotional Value Labels

### Fear/Anxiety
- ❌ "Scary situation" → ✅ "The kind of moment that makes your heart forget its rhythm"
- ❌ "Nervous feeling" → ✅ "Energy that demanded movement, any movement"

### Joy/Excitement
- ❌ "Happy moment" → ✅ "The kind of memory worth treasuring"
- ❌ "Exciting news" → ✅ "Information that changed everything"

### Anger/Frustration
- ❌ "Really mad" → ✅ "Fury that made words inadequate"
- ❌ "Annoying habit" → ✅ "Something that grated after the third repetition"

## Special Considerations

### When Generic Labels Work
Sometimes value labels serve specific purposes:
- **Overwhelming emotion**: "Everything felt wrong" (intentional vagueness)
- **Character inarticulation**: "It's just... good, you know?" (showing speech patterns)
- **Building to revelation**: "Something weird about that place" (mystery setup)

### Multiple Criteria Strategy
- ❌ "Perfect day" → ✅ "Seventy-five degrees, no wind, and three hours of uninterrupted studio time"

### Negative Criteria
- ❌ "Bad idea" → ✅ "The kind of plan that required lies to three different people"

Remember: **Don't tell readers something is good—show them what makes it worthy of that judgment.**
