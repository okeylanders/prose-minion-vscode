# Intensifiers and Hedges - Micro-Guide

## The Problem

Intensifiers like "very," "really," "quite," "so," "extremely" and hedges like "sort of," "kind of," "somewhat," "rather," "fairly" weaken prose by:
- Creating vague impressions instead of concrete images
- Diluting emotional impact
- Adding unnecessary words that slow pacing
- Showing uncertainty in the narrator's voice

## The Transformation

Instead of modifying weak words with intensifiers/hedges, **choose stronger, more specific words** that convey the exact degree of intensity needed.

## Quick Examples

### Intensifiers
- ❌ "very tired" → ✅ "exhausted," "drained," "spent"
- ❌ "really angry" → ✅ "furious," "seething," "incensed" 
- ❌ "quite beautiful" → ✅ "stunning," "radiant," "breathtaking"
- ❌ "so confused" → ✅ "bewildered," "disoriented," "lost"

### Hedges
- ❌ "sort of happy" → ✅ "content," "pleased," "cautiously optimistic"
- ❌ "kind of scared" → ✅ "uneasy," "nervous," "apprehensive"
- ❌ "somewhat disappointed" → ✅ "let down," "deflated," "discouraged"
- ❌ "rather impressed" → ✅ "struck by," "taken with," "drawn to"

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Search and Mark**: Find all intensifiers/hedges in your draft
2. **Question the Base**: What's the core word being modified?
3. **Upgrade**: Replace the entire phrase with a single, precise term
4. **Test**: Does the new word convey the exact shade of meaning?
5. **Context Check**: Does it fit the character's voice and perspective?

## Advanced Techniques

### Sensory Replacement
- ❌ "very loud music" → ✅ "music that rattled the windows"
- ❌ "really cold" → ✅ "breath-stealing wind"

### Emotional Precision
- ❌ "extremely sad" → ✅ "grief that hollowed out his chest"
- ❌ "quite nervous" → ✅ "energy crackling under her skin"

### Action-Based
- ❌ "very carefully" → ✅ "with deliberate, measured steps"
- ❌ "really quickly" → ✅ "in a blur of motion"

Remember: **One strong word beats weak word + modifier every time.**
