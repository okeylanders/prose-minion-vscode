# Placeholder Word Alternatives

This guide provides alternatives for common placeholder words that often appear in first drafts. The goal is to replace vague, telling language with specific, showing language that is more evocative, precise, and in keeping with the novel's voice.

## The Placeholder Problem

Placeholder words are vague, low-impact words that signal a place in the text where a more specific, powerful, or nuanced description is needed. They are useful in a first draft to keep the momentum going, but they should be targeted and replaced in revision.

### Common Placeholder Words:

*   Analytical
*   Interesting
*   Suddenly
*   Realized
*   Looked/Watched/Saw (see gaze-alternatives.md)
*   Felt
*   Nice/Good/Bad
*   Basically/Literally/Actually
*   Just
*   Then
*   Began to/Started to
*   Seemed
*   Very/Really/Quite/So/Kinda/Sort of/A little
*   Almost/Nearly/Practically/Virtually
*   Maybe/Perhaps/Probably
*   Think/Thought/Know/Knew/Wondered/Believe/Guess/Suppose
*   Fine/Okay/Alright
*   Weird/Strange/Odd
*   Awesome/Amazing/Cool
*   Beautiful/Pretty/Ugly/Scary
*   Things/Stuff/Something/Someone
*   Get/Got/Getting; Put/Take/Make/Do; Went/Came
*   Heard/Smelled/Tasted (as filter verbs)
*   Somehow/Somewhere/Sometime/Someday
*   Totally/Completely/Absolutely/Utterly

## Alternatives and "Show, Don't Tell" Examples

### 1. Instead of: "Analytical"

**The Problem:** "Analytical" tells the reader that a character is thinking logically, but it doesn't show what that thought process looks like.

**Try:**

*   **Show the Process:** Describe the character's actions and observations.
    *   "Her eyes catalogued the details of the room, sorting them into categories: threats, assets, unknowns."
    *   "He broke the problem down into its component parts, sketching out a flowchart in his mind."
*   **Use More Specific Adjectives:**
    *   **Diagnostic:** Implies a search for a root cause or problem.
    *   **Scrutinizing:** Suggests a close, critical examination.
    *   **Methodical:** Highlights a step-by-step, orderly approach.
    *   **Clinical:** Conveys a sense of detached, scientific observation (see clinical-descriptors.md).
    *   **Dissecting:** A more visceral word that suggests taking something apart to understand it.

### 2. Instead of: "Interesting"

**The Problem:** "Interesting" is a placeholder for a more specific emotional or intellectual reaction. What *kind* of interesting is it?

**Try:**

*   **Describe the Character's Reaction:**
    *   "A slow smile spread across her face. Now *that* was an idea she could work with."
    *   "He leaned forward, his curiosity piqued."
    *   "The concept was so strange, so unexpected, that it left her momentarily speechless."
*   **Use More Specific Adjectives:**
    *   **Fascinating:** Suggests a deep, captivating quality.
    *   **Provocative:** Implies it challenges one's thinking.
    *   **Unsettling:** A more negative connotation; interesting in a disturbing way.
    *   **Intriguing:** Suggests a mystery to be solved.
    *   **Compelling:** Implies it's hard to look away from.

### 3. Instead of: "Suddenly"

**The Problem:** "Suddenly" is often a lazy way to create surprise. True surprise comes from the unexpected nature of the event itself, not from the adverb that announces it.

**Try:**

*   **Use a Sharp, Declarative Sentence:**
    *   "The door flew open." (Instead of "Suddenly, the door opened.")
    *   "A gunshot shattered the silence." (Instead of "Suddenly, there was a gunshot.")
*   **Focus on the Character's Reaction:**
    *   "One moment, the room was quiet. The next, a crash from the kitchen made her jump, her heart hammering against her ribs."
    *   "He didn't have time to react before the car swerved into his lane."

### 4. Instead of: "Realized"

**The Problem:** "Realized" is a classic "telling" word. It tells the reader what a character has understood, but it doesn't let the reader experience the moment of understanding with the character.

**Try:**

*   **Show the "Aha!" Moment:**
    *   "He stopped, his eyes widening. Of course. It had been there all along, right in front of him."
    *   "The pieces clicked into place in her mind, forming a picture that was both horrifying and perfectly clear."
*   **Use Sensory Details:**
    *   "A cold dread washed over him as he understood the truth."
    *   "It was as if a light had been switched on in a dark room."

### 5. Instead of: "Felt"

**The Problem:** Like "realized," "felt" is a "telling" word. It tells the reader a character's emotion instead of showing it.

**Try:**

*   **Use Physical Sensations:**
    *   "A lump formed in his throat." (Instead of "He felt sad.")
    *   "Her stomach fluttered with nervous energy." (Instead of "She felt nervous.")
*   **Use Actions and Body Language:**
    *   "He slammed his fist on the table, his face a mask of rage." (Instead of "He felt angry.")
    *   "She wrapped her arms around herself, a small, protective gesture." (Instead of "She felt scared.")

### 6. Instead of: "Nice/Good/Bad"

**The Problem:** These are vague, generic adjectives. They don't paint a clear picture for the reader.

**Try:**

*   **Find a More Specific Adjective:**
    *   Instead of "a nice day," try "a warm, sun-drenched afternoon."
    *   Instead of "a good book," try "a gripping, page-turning thriller."
    *   Instead of "a bad situation," try "a tense, life-threatening standoff."

### 7. Instead of: "Very/Really/Quite/So/Kinda/Sort of"

**The Problem:** Intensifiers dilute prose and often mask weak nouns or verbs.

**Try:**

*   **Strengthen the noun or verb:**
    *   "very cold" → "icy," "needle-cold," "knife-cold"
    *   "really tired" → "spent," "bone-tired," "rag-dull"
    *   "sort of smiled" → "his mouth tilted, unsure," "a reluctant corner-lift"
*   **Show the intensity:**
    *   "She was very angry" → "Her jaw set; the next word landed like a slam."
    *   "He was really nervous" → "His hands couldn't find stillness; keys chimed in his pocket."

### 8. Instead of: "Think/Thought/Know/Knew/Wondered"

**The Problem:** Cognition tags tell us a mental state instead of dramatizing the thought or the evidence that produces it.

**Try:**

*   **Render the thought directly (free indirect style):**
    *   "He thought she was lying" → "Her eyes slid to the door before the answer. A beat late. Lying."
*   **Show the inference chain:**
    *   "She knew the plan failed" → "The timer hit zero; the screens stayed black. No failover. Nothing."
*   **Use a sensory or image trigger:**
    *   "He wondered if it mattered" → "The question hung there, a thread he didn't want to pull."

### 9. Instead of: "Maybe/Perhaps/Probably"

**The Problem:** Hedging weakens conviction. If uncertainty belongs to the character, embody it in behavior or environment.

**Try:**

*   **Physical uncertainty:**
    *   "Maybe he should leave" → "He took a step, then stayed, heel grinding the tile."
*   **Situational ambiguity:**
    *   "Perhaps they were late" → "The hallway had emptied; the clock's second hand sounded smug."
*   **Concrete doubt signals:**
    *   "Probably fine" → "The smoke detector blinked green. He didn't trust it."

### 10. Instead of: "Seem/Appear"

**The Problem:** Creates distance unless signaling unreliable perception.

**Try:**

*   **Commit to the perception:**
    *   "The hallway seemed longer" → "The hallway stretched; each step bought less ground."
*   **Make the uncertainty a character experience:**
    *   "It appeared abandoned" → "Dust filmed everything. Even sound felt forgotten."

### 11. Instead of: "Fine/Okay/Alright"

**The Problem:** Vague emotional placeholders that hide the actual state.

**Try:**

*   **Specify functional state:**
    *   "I'm fine" → "I'm upright and passing."
*   **Show the tell:**
    *   "He said he was okay" → "He said he was okay; he folded the napkin until it split."
*   **Swap with precise descriptors:**
    *   "The food was fine" → "Burnt edges; sweet center; it tried to be cake and didn't make it."

### 12. Instead of: "Weird/Strange/Odd"

**The Problem:** Vague judgment rather than observation.

**Try:**

*   **Name the strangeness:**
    *   "Weird smell" → "Bleach cut with pennies."
    *   "Strange feeling" → "A pressure behind the eyes, like air before a storm."
*   **Embed metaphor in action:**
    *   "Odd silence" → "The silence had edges; it trimmed their sentences."

### 13. Instead of: "Awesome/Amazing/Cool"

**The Problem:** Generic praise with no texture.

**Try:**

*   **Show the effect:**
    *   "The painting was amazing" → "He leaned closer without meaning to; the brushwork refused to sit still."
*   **Use domain-specific detail:**
    *   "That shot was awesome" → "He banked off-glass against two bodies; the net whispered."

### 14. Instead of: "Beautiful/Pretty/Ugly/Scary"

**The Problem:** Value labels without specifics.

**Try:**

*   **Concrete criteria:**
    *   "A beautiful day" → "Clear air, hard blue sky, shadows knife-crisp."
    *   "Ugly room" → "Peeling vinyl—brown like old fruit—curling from the corners."
    *   "Scary sound" → "A metal groan from the vents, too slow to be wind."
*   **Emotional echo:**
    *   "Pretty dress" → "Silk that caught the light and threw it back warmer."

### 15. Instead of: "Things/Stuff/Something/Someone"

**The Problem:** Noun fog that hides specificity.

**Try:**

*   **Name the category or items:**
    *   "She carried things" → "She carried brushes, tape, and a sketchbook with a broken coil."
*   **Use evocative collectives:**
    *   "All the stuff on the desk" → "Cord snarl, coffee rings, paper confetti."

### 16. Instead of: Generic Verbs "Get/Got/Getting; Put/Take/Make/Do; Went/Came"

**The Problem:** Utility verbs drain momentum and obscure meaningful action.

**Try:**

*   **Replace with precise action:**
    *   "He got up" → "He pushed off the armrest."
    *   "She put the book down" → "She flattened the book, palms lingering on the cover."
    *   "He went to the door" → "He crossed the carpet; the door loomed closer than he'd planned."
*   **See also:** Writing-Theory-and-Technique/writing-guides/guides/body-movement-action.md

### 17. Instead of: "Heard/Smelled/Tasted" as tags

**The Problem:** Sensory filter words create distance.

**Try:**

*   **Drop the filter and present the sensation:**
    *   "He heard footsteps" → "Footsteps stitched the hallway."
    *   "She smelled smoke" → "Smoke—sharp and sweet—threaded the air."
    *   "He tasted metal" → "Metal on his tongue, penny-faint."

### 18. Instead of: "Almost/Nearly/Practically/Virtually"

**The Problem:** Hedge-intensifiers blur outcomes.

**Try:**

*   **Commit or stage the near-miss:**
    *   "He almost laughed" → "His mouth primed for a laugh and shut again."
    *   "She nearly fell" → "Her ankle rolled; the wall caught her."

### 19. Instead of: "Somehow/Somewhere/Sometime/Someday"

**The Problem:** Vagueness that dodges specifics.

**Try:**

*   **Replace with specific unknowns or clues:**
    *   "Somehow he knew" → "The room's order had shifted; the clock faced the window now. He knew."
    *   "Somewhere in the distance" → "Past the gym and the parking lot, sirens thinned into the sky."

### 20. Instead of: "Totally/Completely/Absolutely/Utterly"

**The Problem:** Redundant intensifiers.

**Try:**

*   **Strengthen the base phrase:**
    *   "Completely silent" → "Soundless."
    *   "Absolutely soaked" → "Water poured from his cuffs."

### 21. Instead of: Emotion Labels "Scared/Sad/Happy/Angry"

**The Problem:** Names emotion instead of dramatizing it.

**Try:**

*   **Body + behavior + object interaction:**
    *   "She was scared" → "She kept her back to the wall and counted her breaths to four."
    *   "He was angry" → "He stacked the papers too neatly, edges flush, breath caging in his throat."
    *   "She was happy" → "Lightness in the knees; the grin arrived before the news finished."

## Other Common Placeholders to Target

*   **Basically/Literally/Actually:** These are often filler words that can be cut without changing the meaning of the sentence.
*   **Just:** Another common filler word. Read the sentence without it. If the meaning doesn't change, cut it.
*   **Then:** This can often be replaced with a more active transition or a new sentence. Instead of "He walked to the door, then he opened it," try "He walked to the door and opened it."
*   **Began to/Started to:** These phrases often weaken the verb. Instead of "She began to run," try "She ran."
*   **Seemed:** This word creates distance and uncertainty. Is the character unsure, or is the author? If it's the character, show their uncertainty in other ways. If it's the author, be more decisive.
*   **Very/Really/Quite/So/Kinda/Sort of/A little:** Intensifiers that mask weak nouns/verbs; strengthen the base word or show the intensity instead.
*   **Maybe/Perhaps/Probably:** Hedge words; embody uncertainty through action, physical hesitation, or sensory ambiguity.
*   **Almost/Nearly/Practically/Virtually:** Hedge-intensifiers that blur outcomes; either commit or stage the near-miss concretely.
*   **Think/Thought/Know/Knew/Wondered/Believe/Guess/Suppose:** Cognition tags; render the thought directly (free indirect) or show the evidence chain that leads to it.
*   **Fine/Okay/Alright:** Vague emotional placeholders; replace with precise state or show the tell through behavior.
*   **Weird/Strange/Odd:** Vague judgment; name the specific anomaly or sensory quality.
*   **Awesome/Amazing/Cool:** Generic praise; show the effect or use domain-specific detail.
*   **Beautiful/Pretty/Ugly/Scary:** Value labels; specify the criteria or render the sensory experience.
*   **Things/Stuff/Something/Someone:** Noun fog; name categories, list concrete items, or use evocative collectives.
*   **Get/Got/Getting; Put/Take/Make/Do; Went/Came:** Generic utility verbs; replace with precise action verbs (see writing-guides/guides/body-movement-action.md).
*   **Heard/Smelled/Tasted (as filter verbs):** Sensory filters create distance; drop the filter and present the sensation directly.
*   **Somehow/Somewhere/Sometime/Someday:** Vagueness markers; replace with specific unknowns or contextual clues.
*   **Totally/Completely/Absolutely/Utterly:** Redundant intensifiers; strengthen the base phrase instead.

## The Revision Workflow

**This document is part of the comprehensive [Descriptors and Placeholders Reference System](../../README.md). For the complete three-pass revision workflow, see [.clinerules/revise-placeholders-and-telling.md](../../../../.clinerules/revise-placeholders-and-telling.md).**

## Quick Reference Workflow

1. **First Pass: Search and Destroy.** Use the "find" function in your word processor to search for these placeholder words. For comprehensive lists, see the micro-guides:
   - [Intensifiers and Hedges](intensifiers-and-hedges.md) - "very," "really," "quite," "so," "kind of"
   - [Noun Fog to Specificity](noun-fog-to-specificity.md) - "things," "stuff," "something," "someone"
   - [Value Labels to Criteria](value-labels-to-criteria.md) - "good," "bad," "nice," "weird"
   - [Utility Verbs Precision](../verbs/utility-verbs-precision.md) - "get," "put," "make," "do," "went"
   - [Sensory Filter Alternatives](../sensory-filters/sensory-filter-alternatives.md) - "heard," "saw," "felt," "smelled"
   - [Cognition Tags to Free Indirect Style](../cognition/cognition-tags-to-free-indirect-style.md) - "thought," "realized," "wondered"
   - [Filler and Chaining Words](../filler/filler-and-chaining-words.md) - "actually," "basically," "just," "then"

2. **Second Pass: Analyze and Replace.** For each instance you find, ask yourself:
   * What am I really trying to say here?
   * Can I show this instead of telling it?
   * Is there a more specific, powerful, or evocative word I can use?
   * Use the micro-guides above for principled replacement strategies.

3. **Third Pass: Read Aloud.** Read the revised section aloud to make sure the new language flows naturally and the rhythm is right. Use [expression snippet alternatives](../../../writing-guides/snippets/) for quick fixes to common patterns.

**For complete vocabulary support, see the [Catalogs section](../../catalogs/) organized by theme (environment, movement, sensory, etc.).**
