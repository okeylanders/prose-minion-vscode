# Cognition Tags to Free Indirect Style - Micro-Guide

## The Problem

Cognition tags like "thought," "realized," "wondered," "knew," "remembered," "decided" create distance between readers and characters by:
- Creating clunky he-thought/she-realized constructions
- Adding unnecessary reporting language
- Breaking immersion with constant mental activity announcements
- Missing opportunities for elegant free indirect discourse
- Creating repetitive sentence patterns

## The Transformation

**Replace cognition tags with free indirect discourse that flows seamlessly between narrator and character consciousness.**

## Quick Examples

### Think/Thought
- ❌ "He thought the plan was risky" → ✅ "The plan reeked of unnecessary risk"
- ❌ "She thought about her options" → ✅ "Three paths stretched ahead, none appealing"
- ❌ "Nate thought the colors clashed" → ✅ "The colors fought each other across the canvas"

### Realized
- ❌ "She realized he was lying" → ✅ "The truth hit her: every word was fabrication"
- ❌ "He realized his mistake" → ✅ "The error crystallized, undeniable"
- ❌ "Ava realized something was wrong" → ✅ "Something was wrong—terribly, obviously wrong"

### Wondered/Asked Himself
- ❌ "He wondered if she cared" → ✅ "Did she care? The question gnawed at him"
- ❌ "She wondered why he left" → ✅ "Why had he left without explanation?"
- ❌ "Jasper wondered about the implications" → ✅ "What did this mean for everything else?"

### Knew/Understood
- ❌ "He knew she was right" → ✅ "She was right, as usual"
- ❌ "They knew they were in trouble" → ✅ "Trouble had found them, no question"
- ❌ "Nate knew the deadline was approaching" → ✅ "Three days. The deadline loomed"

### Remembered/Recalled
- ❌ "She remembered their first meeting" → ✅ "That first meeting—awkward handshakes and nervous laughter"
- ❌ "He remembered the advice" → ✅ "Dad's words echoed: 'Trust your instincts'"
- ❌ "Micah remembered the play" → ✅ "Fourth down, two seconds left—the memory burned bright"

## The HPC Application

### Character-Specific Mental Patterns

**Nate (Artistic Processing)**:
- ❌ "Nate thought about composition" → ✅ "The composition needed something—a focal point, a anchor"
- ❌ "He realized the technique was wrong" → ✅ "Wrong technique. The brushstrokes fought the vision"

**Ava (Emotional Intelligence)**:
- ❌ "Ava wondered about his mood" → ✅ "Something was off—the way he held his shoulders, avoided eye contact"
- ❌ "She knew he was upset" → ✅ "Upset. The word was too small for the storm behind his eyes"

**Jasper (Analytical Mind)**:
- ❌ "Jasper thought through the problem" → ✅ "Variable A plus Variable B... but Variable C changed everything"
- ❌ "He realized the contradiction" → ✅ "Wait. That contradicted everything Professor Chen had established"

**Micah (Kinesthetic Thinking)**:
- ❌ "Micah thought about the game" → ✅ "Fourth quarter. Two-point deficit. Time to show what they were made of"

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Identify the Tag**: Find cognition verbs acting as filters
2. **Extract the Thought**: What's the actual mental content?
3. **Direct Presentation**: Present the thought without the tag
4. **Character Voice**: Adjust the mental voice to match the character
5. **Flow Check**: Ensure smooth transition between narration and thought

## Advanced Techniques

### Questions Instead of Wondering
- ❌ "She wondered if it was true" → ✅ "Could it be true? The possibility terrified her"
- ❌ "He wondered what to do" → ✅ "What now? Every option seemed impossible"

### Statements Instead of Knowing
- ❌ "They knew they were late" → ✅ "Late. Twenty minutes late, and Dr. Chen was unforgiving"
- ❌ "She knew the answer" → ✅ "The answer was obvious, had always been obvious"

### Sensory Memory Instead of Remembering
- ❌ "He remembered the smell" → ✅ "Paint thinner and turpentine—the studio's distinctive perfume"
- ❌ "She remembered his voice" → ✅ "His voice, warm and certain: 'You've got this'"

### Process Instead of Deciding
- ❌ "She decided to stay" → ✅ "Leave? No. Whatever came next, she'd face it here"
- ❌ "He decided it was time" → ✅ "Time. Past time, if he was honest"

## Emotional Cognition Patterns

### Doubt/Uncertainty
- ❌ "She wasn't sure if she believed him" → ✅ "His explanation felt thin, rehearsed"
- ❌ "He didn't know what to think" → ✅ "Nothing made sense anymore"

### Recognition/Understanding
- ❌ "She finally understood" → ✅ "Of course. The pieces clicked into place"
- ❌ "He got it now" → ✅ "Everything suddenly made terrible sense"

### Worry/Fear
- ❌ "She was worried about the outcome" → ✅ "What if everything went wrong? What if—?"
- ❌ "He was afraid of failing" → ✅ "Failure loomed, vast and hungry"

## Special Techniques

### Interrupted Thoughts
- ❌ "He thought about calling her, but then reconsidered" → ✅ "Call her? No—what would he even say?"

### Layered Consciousness
- ❌ "She thought she should be angry, but felt sad instead" → ✅ "Anger would be easier. This sadness was too heavy to carry"

### Present-Tense Mental Activity
- ❌ "He was thinking hard" → ✅ "Solutions. There had to be solutions hidden somewhere"

## When Cognition Tags Work

Sometimes cognition tags serve specific narrative purposes:
- **Emphasis**: "He thought—really thought—about what she'd said"
- **Character voice**: "She wondered, as she often did, whether..."
- **Transition**: "But then he remembered something crucial"
- **Uncertainty**: "Did he know? She thought maybe, possibly..."

## Brighton Academy Contexts

### Academic Thinking
- ❌ "Students thought about the question" → ✅ "The question hung in the air, challenging"
- ❌ "He realized the professor was right" → ✅ "Professor Chen was right—again"

### Spiritual Processing
- ❌ "She wondered about faith" → ✅ "Faith. Such a small word for something so immense"
- ❌ "He thought about God" → ✅ "Where was God in all this chaos?"

Remember: **Let readers experience thoughts directly rather than watching characters think.**
