# Utility Verbs Precision - Micro-Guide

## The Problem

Generic utility verbs like "get/got/getting," "put/take/make/do," and "went/came" create weak prose by:
- Providing minimal specific information about action
- Missing opportunities for character development
- Creating bland, forgettable scenes
- Failing to establish mood or atmosphere through movement

## The Transformation

**Replace utility verbs with precise, evocative verbs that reveal character, create atmosphere, and specify exact actions.**

## Quick Examples

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Hunt the Utility**: Search for get/got, put/take, make/do, went/came
2. **Identify the Real Action**: What's actually happening?
3. **Character Filter**: How would this character perform this action?
4. **Mood Consideration**: What atmosphere should this action create?
5. **Precision Test**: Does the new verb specify exactly what's occurring?
