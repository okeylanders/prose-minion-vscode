## Usage Notes & Guidance

1. Pick the nuance first. Ask: Do I mean 'quiet', 'agreement', 'seating', 'emotional easing', 'anchoring', or 'practical closure'?
2. Vary register to match scene tone. Everyday realism benefits from plain verbs; prophetic scenes allow benediction-like language; intimate or lyrical moments can carry metaphors.
3. Combine micro-phrases with sensory detail to keep prose grounded (e.g., "They fell silent. The radiator clicked twice.").
4. Avoid over-lyrical language in group scenes where clarity and pacing matter; choose one distinct poetic image per paragraph to maintain impact.
5. Use physical micro-actions (hands unclench, fabric sighs, chairs scraping) to show 'settled' without naming it.
6. For Nate's moments of artistic or spiritual integration, prefer metaphors that tie to light, texture, or art (e.g., "the conversation folded like paper; the margins cleared").
