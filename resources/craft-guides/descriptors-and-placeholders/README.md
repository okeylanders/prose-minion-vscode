# Descriptors and Placeholders Reference System

**The complete reference system for transforming weak placeholder language into powerful, evocative prose.**

This reorganized system supports the three-pass revision workflow outlined in [.clinerules/revise-placeholders-and-telling.md](../../.clinerules/revise-placeholders-and-telling.md):
1. **First Pass**: "Search and Destroy" mission using transformation guides
2. **Second Pass**: "Show, Don't Tell" transformation using micro-guides  
3. **Third Pass**: Rhythmic read-aloud for flow and character voice

## Usage Workflow

### Revision Phase 1: Search and Destroy
1. **Target Search**: Use transformation micro-guides to identify placeholder words
2. **Mark and Highlight**: Note every instance for systematic replacement
3. **Category Focus**: Work through one transformation category at a time

### Revision Phase 2: Show, Don't Tell  
1. **Replace Placeholders**: Use micro-guides for principled alternatives
2. **Add Sensory Details**: Draw from relevant catalog sections
3. **Character Integration**: Ensure replacements match POV character voice
4. **Context Appropriateness**: Select details that fit scene and mood

### Revision Phase 3: Rhythmic Polish
1. **Quick-Reference Snippets**: Use expression alternatives for common patterns  
2. **Character Voice**: Ensure consistency with established personalities
3. **Flow Check**: Read aloud to catch awkward constructions
