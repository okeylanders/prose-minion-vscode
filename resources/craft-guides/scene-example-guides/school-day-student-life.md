## INTRODUCTION

High school hallways, classrooms, and cafeterias have their own rhythms. There’s subtle tension in pop quizzes, the quick chaos of switching classes, and the messy camaraderie of lunch. Rather than relying on generic phrases like “she opened her locker” or “the students sat in class,” you can paint a more immersive scene by noting micro-expressions, posture shifts, the rustle of backpacks, and the ambient chatter that underpins student life.

Use the following guide to elevate ordinary moments—pulling the reader into the experiences, quirks, and emotions that shape school days.

## 7) SHOW, DON’T TELL SAMPLES

**Instead of:** “She went to her locker, looking tired.”

**Instead of:** “They had lunch and talked.”  
_Try:_

## 8) TIPS & REMINDERS

• **Balance Everyday Detail with Character Emotion:** Let students’ interactions with lockers or lunch trays mirror their current moods—joy blooms over a favorite snack; frustration surfaces in a slammed metal door.  
• **Keep Pace in Mind:** School scenes can be quick transitions between classes or lull with the quiet of note-taking. Adjust your detail level accordingly.  
• **Emphasize Sensory Elements:** Mention the smell of the cafeteria, the echo of hundreds of voices in the hallway, the squeak of shoes on linoleum.  
• **Reflect Social Strata & Friendships:** Who lingers by each other’s lockers? Which table do they choose at lunch? Social dynamics can often be shown through close observation rather than direct explanation.  
• **Character Quirks:** Some students doodle nonstop, others can’t sit still, and some might meticulously organize their lockers. Small habits reveal personality.

## 9) CLOSING THOUGHT

Everyday school life brims with drama in the small moments—shared laughter over tater tots, the subtle friction of a too-small desk, or the precarious click of a barely secure locker combination. By weaving detail and allowing your characters to express their thoughts, feelings, and relationships through gestures and moods, you create a slice of life that resonates with authenticity. Lean on both precise observation and evocative language to bring teenage experiences into sharp, relatable focus.
