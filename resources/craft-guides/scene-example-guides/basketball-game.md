## INTRODUCTION

Basketball games are dynamic: squeaking sneakers, the echo of a bouncing ball, the thrum of spectators. Tension crackles as the shot clock winds down. Instead of a flat “he dribbled up the court,” you can weave detail and atmosphere into each movement. Whether your scene is set in a professional arena, a high-school gym, or a street court, the same principle applies: combine concrete physical description with emotional beats to capture each thrilling moment.
