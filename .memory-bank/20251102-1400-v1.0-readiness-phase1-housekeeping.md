## 🚧 Planned Work (Not Yet Started)

### From Search Architecture Epic:
1. **Sprint 6: Architecture Pass I** (Deferred to v1.1+)
   - Abstract AI client interface
   - Prepare for multi-provider support
   - **Rationale for deferral**: Current architecture scores 9.8/10; OpenRouter integration works excellently

2. **Sprint 7: Architecture Pass II** (Deferred to v1.1+)
   - Service segmentation
   - Handler composition refinements
   - **Rationale for deferral**: Recent refactors achieved excellent separation of concerns

3. **Sprint 8: Context Search** (Deferred to v1.1+)
   - AI-assisted search expansions
   - Category/synonym/variant search
   - **Rationale for deferral**: This is a new feature, not core functionality; great "what's new in v1.1" feature

### Draft ADRs (Research Phase):
- **Prose Playground Assistant** (2025-10-26)
  - Status: Draft
  - Scope: Significant new feature
  - **Recommendation**: Defer to v1.2+ or post-v1.0 research

## 🎯 Recommended Path to v1.0

### Critical (Must-Have for v1.0):

#### 1. End-User Documentation ✍️
**Time**: 2-4 hours
**Priority**: HIGH

- [ ] Write marketplace-ready README.md
  - Installation instructions
  - Quick start guide
  - Feature overview with screenshots
  - API key setup walkthrough
  - Model selection guide
- [ ] Create CONFIGURATION.md guide
  - All settings explained
  - Publishing standards setup
  - Context paths configuration
- [ ] Record demo GIFs/videos
  - Dialogue analysis in action
  - Dictionary lookup
  - Metrics (prose stats, word frequency, style flags)
  - Search functionality
  - Settings overlay tour

#### 2. Manual Testing Pass 🧪
**Time**: 4-6 hours
**Priority**: CRITICAL

Based on [20251102-1245 memory bank](.memory-bank/20251102-1245-presentation-epic-final-polish-and-review.md) checklist:

- [ ] All tabs render correctly
- [ ] Model selectors visible immediately (bug already fixed)
- [ ] Analysis: dialogue and prose
- [ ] Dictionary: word lookup with context
- [ ] Context: generation with source metadata
- [ ] Metrics: all three tools (prose_stats, style_flags, word_frequency)
- [ ] Search: word search with different scopes
- [ ] Settings overlay: all settings changes
- [ ] State persistence: survives webview reload
- [ ] Token tracking: real-time updates
- [ ] Error handling: domain-specific clearing
- [ ] Dark/light theme compatibility
- [ ] Fresh install test (clean VSCode instance)
- [ ] User-friendly error messages

#### 3. CHANGELOG.md 📝
**Time**: 1-2 hours
**Priority**: MEDIUM

- [ ] Document all features since inception
- [ ] Highlight major capabilities
- [ ] List all completed epics
- [ ] Note architecture achievements
- [ ] Credit research and references

#### 4. Marketplace Polish 🎨
**Time**: 2-3 hours
**Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH

- [ ] Convert icon to PNG (128x128px) for marketplace
- [ ] Create gallery images/banner
- [ ] Write compelling marketplace description
- [ ] Add feature badges/tags
- [ ] Review VSCode extension guidelines

### Nice-to-Have (Optional):

#### 5. Automated Tests (v1.1+)
- Unit tests for critical paths
- Integration tests for message routing
- **Rationale for deferral**: Manual testing sufficient for v1.0; add tests incrementally

#### 6. Telemetry/Analytics (v1.1+)
- Usage metrics for improvement
- Error tracking
- **Rationale for deferral**: Focus on core functionality first
