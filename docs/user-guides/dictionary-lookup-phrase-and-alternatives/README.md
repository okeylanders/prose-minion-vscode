# Dictionary | Looking Up Phrases and Requesting Alternatives

This guide demonstrates how to use the Writer's Dictionary to look up a phrase and get context-aware alternative phrasings for your prose.

![Inputting Phrase & Requesting Alternatives](../../../screenshots/dictionary/screenshot-guide-lookup-phrase-alternative-hero.png)

## Purpose

The Writer's Dictionary goes beyond standard definitions to provide:
- **Deep semantic analysis** of words and phrases
- **Context-aware alternatives** tailored to your specific sentence
- **Craft-focused insights** including tonal sliders, genre pointers, and cliche warnings
- **Character voice variations** showing how different narrators might express the same idea

This is particularly useful when you want to:
- Freshen overused phrases in your manuscript
- Find alternatives that match a specific tone or mood
- Explore the full semantic range of a descriptor
- Get AI-powered suggestions based on your actual sentence context

## Instructions

### Step 1: Enter the Target Phrase

In the **Target Word or Phrase** field, enter the word or phrase you want to look up (maximum 6 words).

**Tip**: If you select text in your editor before opening the Dictionary tab, it will auto-populate this field and show the source file.

### Step 2: Add Optional Context

In the **Optional Context** field, provide:
- The sentence where you're using the phrase
- What you're trying to achieve (e.g., "I want to re-word this descriptor")
- Any specific tone or effect you're going for

This context helps the AI tailor its alternatives to your specific use case.

**Example context from the screenshot:**
> *I want to re-word the descriptor surgical precision in this sentence can you provide some options:*
>
> *"She reached over without warning and plucked at his arm hair with surgical precision"*

### Step 3: Run the Lookup

Click **"Run Dictionary Lookup"** to generate the full entry.

**Note**: Use the standard "Run Dictionary Lookup" button (not the experimental fast mode) when requesting alternatives. The single-LLM-call approach produces more cohesive results when one model is responsible for the entire entry, especially for "re-word" instructions.

The experimental mode splits work across multiple agents for faster results, which works well for standard lookups but may produce less unified suggestions when you need alternatives.

## Usage Watchpoints
- **Cliché saturation**: Extremely overused in action fiction, military reporting, and sports commentary since the 1990s. Consider freshening.
- **Emotional contradiction**: In your context ("plucked at his arm hair"), the phrase creates tension between intimate touch and clinical distance—this can be powerful or jarring depending on intent.
- **Tonal mismatch**: Avoid in tender, romantic, or comedic scenes unless irony is intended.
- **Reader fatigue**: If your manuscript already contains medical/clinical language, this reinforces that semantic field—ensure variety.
- **Cultural sensitivity**: In medical fiction, verify accuracy to avoid trivializing actual surgical work.

## Semantic Gradient (Coldness/Detachment Scale)
gentle touch → careful handling → methodical removal → **surgical precision** → clinical detachment → robotic efficiency → mechanical ruthlessness → cold brutality

## Semantic Gradient (Accuracy Scale)
approximate → careful → meticulous → **surgical precision** → atomic accuracy → quantum-level exactitude → impossible perfection

## AI Advisory Notes
- The phrase has become a **dead metaphor** in many contexts—readers may gloss over it without registering the imagery.
- In your specific sentence, the juxtaposition of "without warning" + "surgical precision" creates interesting cognitive dissonance: planned vs. spontaneous.
- Consider whether you want to emphasize **speed** (sniper-like), **coldness** (clinical), **skill** (virtuosic), or **cruelty** (sadistic control).
- The action (plucking arm hair) is inherently minor and intimate—pairing it with "surgical precision" elevates it to psychological warfare or power-play territory.

**Recommendation for your sentence:**
Given the intimate, potentially unsettling nature of the action, consider whether "surgical precision" serves your tonal goals. If you want **clinical coldness**, keep it or swap to "clinical detachment." If you want **playful cruelty**, try "sadistic exactitude" or "predatory care." If you want **speed**, use "cobra-strike swiftness." If you want **fresh imagery**, consider "pickpocket dexterity" or "as if plucking harp strings."

The phrase's strength is its immediate clarity; its weakness is its ubiquity. Choose based on whether you prioritize **instant recognition** or **memorable originality**.
